That's why iPods, digital cameras, smartphones, Game Boys, and the Wil have sold millions of units. These devices require lots of power and can drain batteries quickly. Battery manufacturers are constantly searching for ways to build longer-lasting batteries. A particular manufacturer produces AA batteries that are designed to last an average of 17 hours with a standard deviation of 0.8 hours. Quality control inspectors select a random sample of 50 batteries during each hour of production, and they then drain them under conditions that mimic normal use. Here are the lifetimes (in hours) of the batteries from one such sample: 673 1560 1631 17.57 16.14 17.28 1667 17.28 17.27 1750 15.46 16.50 16.19 559 1754 16.46 15.63 1652 1716 1662 16.71 16.69 1798 16 36 17.s0 1661 9915.64 17.20 17.24 16.68 1655 17.48 15.58 1761 15.98 16.99 1693 1601 754 741 16.91 1660 16.78 15.75 17.31 16.50 1672 17.55 16.46 Do these data suggest that the production process is working properly? Is it safe for plant managers to send out all the batteries produced in this hour for sale? In this chapter, you will develop the tools you need to help answer questions like this. \r\nBetterBatterles (1).pdf+ BL\u0130ldingBetter Batteries%20(1).pdf case closed Building Better Batteries Refer to the chapter-opening Case Study on page 421. Assuming the process is working properly, the population distribution of battery lifetimes has mean \u03bc-17 hours and standard deviation \u03c3-0.8, we don't know the shape of the population distribution. 1. Make an appropriate graph to display the sample data. Describe what you see. 2. Assume that the battery production process is working properly. Describe the shape, center, and spread of the sampling distribution of X is for random samples of 50 batteries. Justify your answers For the random sample of 50 batteries, the average lifetime was x-16.7 18 hours. 3. Find the probability of obtaining a random sample of 50 batteries with a mean lifetime of 16.718 hours or less if the production process is working properly. Show your work. Based on your answer, do you believe that the process is working properly? Why or why not? The plant manager also wants to know what proportion p of all the batteries produced that day lasted less than 16.5 hours, which he has declared \"unsuitable.\" From past experience, about 27% of batteries made at the plant are unsuitable. If the manager does not find convincing evidence that the proportion of unsuitable batteries p produced that day is greater than 0.27, the whole batch of batteries will be shipped to customers. 4. Assume that the actual proportion of unsuitable batteries produced that day is p 0.27. Describe the shape, center, and spread of the sampling distribution of i for random samples of 50 batteries.
