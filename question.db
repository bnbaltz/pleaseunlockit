That's why iPods, digital cameras, smartphones, Game Boys, and the Wil have sold millions of units. These devices require lots of power and can drain batteries quickly. Battery manufacturers are constantly searching for ways to build longer-lasting batteries. A particular manufacturer produces AA batteries that are designed to last an average of 17 hours with a standard deviation of 0.8 hours. Quality control inspectors select a random sample of 50 batteries during each hour of production, and they then drain them under conditions that mimic normal use. Here are the lifetimes (in hours) of the batteries from one such sample: 673 1560 1631 17.57 16.14 17.28 1667 17.28 17.27 1750 15.46 16.50 16.19 559 1754 16.46 15.63 1652 1716 1662 16.71 16.69 1798 16 36 17.s0 1661 9915.64 17.20 17.24 16.68 1655 17.48 15.58 1761 15.98 16.99 1693 1601 754 741 16.91 1660 16.78 15.75 17.31 16.50 1672 17.55 16.46 Do these data suggest that the production process is working properly? Is it safe for plant managers to send out all the batteries produced in this hour for sale? In this chapter, you will develop the tools you need to help answer questions like this. \r\nBetterBatterles (1).pdf+ BL\u0130ldingBetter Batteries%20(1).pdf case closed Building Better Batteries Refer to the chapter-opening Case Study on page 421. Assuming the process is working properly, the population distribution of battery lifetimes has mean \u03bc-17 hours and standard deviation \u03c3-0.8, we don't know the shape of the population distribution. 1. Make an appropriate graph to display the sample data. Describe what you see. 2. Assume that the battery production process is working properly. Describe the shape, center, and spread of the sampling distribution of X is for random samples of 50 batteries. Justify your answers For the random sample of 50 batteries, the average lifetime was x-16.7 18 hours. 3. Find the probability of obtaining a random sample of 50 batteries with a mean lifetime of 16.718 hours or less if the production process is working properly. Show your work. Based on your answer, do you believe that the process is working properly? Why or why not? The plant manager also wants to know what proportion p of all the batteries produced that day lasted less than 16.5 hours, which he has declared \"unsuitable.\" From past experience, about 27% of batteries made at the plant are unsuitable. If the manager does not find convincing evidence that the proportion of unsuitable batteries p produced that day is greater than 0.27, the whole batch of batteries will be shipped to customers. 4. Assume that the actual proportion of unsuitable batteries produced that day is p 0.27. Describe the shape, center, and spread of the sampling distribution of i for random samples of 50 batteries.

One such operation is hole counting. Some Background on Hole Counting (from Shapiro and Stockman's 2001 Computer Vision) In the late 1970s an engineer in Milwaukee implemented a machine vision system that successfully counted the number of bolt holes in crossbars made for truck companies. The truck companies demanded that every crossbar be inspected before being shipped to them, because a missing bolt hole on a partly assembled truck was a very costly defect. Either the assembly line would have to be stopped while the needed hole was drilled, or worse, a worker might ignore placing a required bolt in order to keep the production line running. To create a digital image of the truck crossbar, lights were placed beneath the existing transfer line and a digital camera above it. When a crossbar came into the field of view, an image was taken. Dark pixels inside the shadow of the crossbar were represented as 1s indicating steel, and pixels in the bright holes were represented as 0s, indicating that the hole was drilled. The number of holes can be computed as the number of external corners minus the number of internal corners all divided by four. An external corner is just a 2 x 2 set of neighboring pixels containing exactly 3 ones, while an internal corner is a 2 x 2 set of neighboring pixels containing exactly 3 zeros. Hole Counting Practice To visualize a binary (black and white) image, we will assume that 0s are black (the \u201choles\u201d) and 1s are white (the \u201csteel\u201d). Here is a simple 6 x 6 set of pixels forming an image. Fill in the blank cells with \u201ce\u201d or \u201ci\u201d if they are external or internal corners, and calculate the number of holes using the formula. The solution is on the following page. Here are the correctly-filled-in cells: Calculate the number of holes using the formula described in the background:   #holes = (#e - #i) / 4\n  #holes = (9 \u2013 1) / 4\n  #holes = 2\n A Note The hole counting algorithm will not work for all arrangements of binary pixels. Can you think of examples in which the hole counting algorithm would fail? Your program will only be tested on cases where this simple algorithm produces the correct hole count. Your Tasks Complete the Project 6 by writing code for the following functions. Details of type for the functions can be found in functions.h (provided for you, see details below): readImage \u2013 Reads in lines of 0s and 1s and returns a binary multidimensional vector. Inputs: Two integers \u2013 the number of columns and the number of rows, respectively. Output: The image stored in a two-dimensional vector of ints. printImage \u2013 Outputs the binary image of the multidimensional vector returned by readImage. For formatting, see the output files. Input: Two dimensional vector of ints. Output: Nothing (void). Should print to terminal. countHoles \u2013 Returns the number of holes in the multidimensional vector returned by readImage. Inputs: The two dimensional vector of ints (the image). Outputs: The number of holes as an int. Test Cases \u2022 6 test cases Assignment Notes 1. You are given the following files: main.cpp \u2013 This file includes the main function where the test cases will be run. Do not modify this file. functions.h \u2013 This file is the header file for your functions.cpp file. Do not modify this file. input#.txt \u2013 These four text files will be used to run the test cases. d. correct_output_#.txt \u2013 These text files will be used to grade your output based on the corresponding input files. Be sure that your output matches these text files exactly to get credit for the test cases. You will write only functions.cpp and compile that file using functions.h and main.cpp in the same directory (as you have done in the lab). You are only turning in functions.cpp for the project. Comparing outputs: You can use redirected output to compare the output of your program to the correct output. Use redirected output and the \u201cdiff\u201d command in the Unix terminal to accomplish this: Run your executable on the desired input file. Let\u2019s assume you\u2019re testing input1.txt, the first test case. Redirect the output using the following line when in your directory: ./a.out < input1.txt > output1.txt Now your output is in the file output1.txt. Compare output1.txt to correct_output1.txt using the following line: diff output1.txt correct_output1.txt If the two files match, nothing will be output to the terminal. Otherwise, \u201cdiff \u201cwill print the two outputs. main.cpp: #include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\nusing std::cout;using std::cin;using std::endl;\nusing std::vector;\n\n#include

but powerful algorithms we can use to extract properties of those images. One such operation is hole counting.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p><strong>Some Background on Hole Counting&nbsp;</strong></p> \n  <p>(from Shapiro and Stockman's 2001&nbsp;<em>Computer Vision</em>)&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>In the late 1970s an engineer in Milwaukee implemented a machine vision system that successfully counted the number of bolt holes in crossbars made for truck companies. The truck companies demanded that every crossbar be inspected before being shipped to them, because a missing bolt hole on a partly assembled truck was a very costly defect. Either the assembly line would have to be stopped while the needed hole was drilled, or worse, a worker might ignore placing a required bolt in order to keep the production line running. To create a digital image of the truck crossbar, lights were placed beneath the existing transfer line and a digital camera above it. When a crossbar came into the field of view, an image was taken. Dark pixels inside the shadow of the crossbar were represented as 1s indicating steel, and pixels in the bright holes were represented as 0s, indicating that the hole was drilled. The number of holes can be computed as the number of external corners minus the number of internal corners all divided by four.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>An&nbsp;<em>external corner&nbsp;</em>is just a 2 x 2 set of neighboring pixels containing exactly 3 ones, while an&nbsp;<em>internal corner&nbsp;</em>is a 2 x 2 set of neighboring pixels containing exactly 3 zeros.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p><strong>Hole Counting Practice&nbsp;</strong></p> \n  <p>To visualize a binary (black and white) image, we will assume that 0s are black (the \u201choles\u201d) and 1s are white (the \u201csteel\u201d). Here is a simple 6 x 6 set of pixels forming an image.</p> \n  <p><img alt=\"T 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 \" src=\"//d2vlcm61l7u1fs.cloudfront.net/media%2Fa30%2Fa30f31ea-05af-4706-821a-6a8a5cda1dff%2Fphp78GacI.png\" style=\"height:216px;width:200px;\" /></p> \n  <p>Fill in the blank cells with \u201ce\u201d or \u201ci\u201d if they are external or internal corners, and calculate the number of holes using the formula. The solution is on the following page.</p> \n  <p>Here are the correctly-filled-in cells:</p> \n  <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"//d2vlcm61l7u1fs.cloudfront.net/media%2F38c%2F38cbbce5-03bf-42b6-a1e5-db532cee0bfe%2Fphpagh9Q5.png\" style=\"height:150px;width:250px;\" /></p> \n  <p>Calculate the number of holes using the formula described in the background:&nbsp;</p> \n  <pre>\n  #holes = (#e - #i) / 4\n  #holes = (9 \u2013 1) / 4\n  #holes = 2\n</pre> \n  <p><strong>A Note&nbsp;</strong></p> \n  <p>The hole counting algorithm will not work for all arrangements of binary pixels. Can you think of examples in which the hole counting algorithm would fail?&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>Your program will only be tested on cases where this simple algorithm produces the correct hole count.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p><strong>Your Tasks&nbsp;</strong></p> \n  <p>Complete the Project 6 by writing code for the following functions. Details of type for the functions can be found in functions.h (provided for you, see details below):&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>readImage \u2013 Reads in lines of 0s and 1s and returns a binary multidimensional vector.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>Inputs: Two integers \u2013 the number of columns and the number of rows, respectively.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>Output: The image stored in a two-dimensional vector of ints.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>printImage \u2013 Outputs the binary image of the multidimensional vector returned by readImage. For formatting, see the output files.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>Input: Two dimensional vector of ints.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>Output: Nothing (void). Should print to terminal.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>countHoles \u2013 Returns the number of holes in the multidimensional vector returned by&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>readImage.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>Inputs: The two dimensional vector of ints (the image).&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>Outputs: The number of holes as an int.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p><strong>Test Cases&nbsp;</strong></p> \n  <p>\u2022 6 test cases&nbsp;</p> \n  <p><strong>Assignment Notes&nbsp;</strong></p> \n  <p>1. You are given the following files:&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>main.cpp \u2013 This file includes the main function where the test cases will be run.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p><strong>Do not modify&nbsp;</strong>this file.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>functions.h \u2013 This file is the header file for your functions.cpp file.&nbsp;<strong>Do not&nbsp;</strong></p> \n  <p><strong>modify&nbsp;</strong>this file.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>input#.txt \u2013 These four text files will be used to run the test cases.</p> \n  <p>d. correct_output_#.txt \u2013 These text files will be used to grade your output based on the corresponding input files. Be sure that your output matches these text files exactly to get credit for the test cases.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>You will write only functions.cpp and compile that file using functions.h and main.cpp in the same directory (as you have done in the lab). You are only turning in functions.cpp for the project.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>Comparing outputs: You can use redirected output to compare the output of your program to the correct output. Use redirected output and the \u201cdiff\u201d command in the Unix terminal to accomplish this:&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>Run your executable on the desired input file. Let\u2019s assume you\u2019re testing input1.txt, the first test case. Redirect the output using the following line when in your directory: ./a.out &lt; input1.txt &gt; output1.txt&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>Now your output is in the file output1.txt. Compare output1.txt to correct_output1.txt using the following line: diff output1.txt correct_output1.txt&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>If the two files match, nothing will be output to the terminal. Otherwise, \u201cdiff \u201cwill print the two outputs.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>&nbsp;</p> \n  <p><strong>main.cpp:</strong></p> \n  <pre>\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\n#include &lt;vector&gt;\nusing

Her other assets included an interest in a real estate partnership, a residence on Staten Island, and bank accounts. When Madeline's son Peter was going through a divorce, Madeline wanted to prevent his wife from obtaining any of Madeline's assets. She removed Peter from her will, leaving her daughter Lisa as the sole beneficiary. Lisa orally agreed to transfer half of the assets to Peter after the divorce.

BACKGROUND Newton's laws of motion describe the relationship between a massive object and the forces acting upon that object, and the object's motion in response to those forces. More precisely, the first law defines the force qualitatively, the second law offers a quantitative description of the force, and the third asserts that a single isolated force doesn't exist. Though the laws have been stated in slightly different ways over the past three centuries, they can be summarized as follows: Law 1 In an inertial frame of reference, an object moves at a constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force. Law 2 In an inertial frame of reference, the vector net force' Fnet on an object is equal to the mass m of that object multiplied by the acceleration a of the object: Fnet = ma. (1) This definition of the law assumes a constant mass'. Law 3 When one object exerts a force on a second object, the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first body. These laws hold the necessary information to describe the motion of massive objects. Even so, seeing an equation or a few laws on a page does not immediately instill understanding of those things. The net force is equivalent to the sum of the forces \u03a3F.. The more general law for a non-constant mass is dp F. where p = mv is the momentum. But the mass cannot simply be treated as a function of time. For more on variable-mass systems, read the Wikipedia article The idea of simultaneity is an approximation that breaks down at high speeds. Einstein's special theory of relativity describes the breakdown. For this class, however, we will assume there is no breakdown in Newton's third law. \r\nPART 1: Varying Applied Force 1. Navigate to The Physics Classroom's interactive interface. Open the interface such that you see something like Figure 1. You will need to open it up to be full screen. Some of the interactive elements don't always work in windowed mode. Mass (kg) Push It 3.0 Applied Force (8) 10.0 Surface Friction Velocity 0.30 Time Figure 1: The Physics Classroom's force interactive interface. 2. Set the mass to 3.0 kg and the friction coefficient (the third box) to a value of 0.30, as shown in Figure 1. This value indicates that we are including non-zero friction in our analysis. With this fact in mind, draw a free-body diagram of the block: draw and label all the forces acting on the block. Note: Take the applied force to be rightward. \r\n3. The frictional force is defined as Ffric = un, (2) where he is friction coefficient and n is the support (normal) force. Using the free-body diagram you drew above, calculate the normal force n: n = N Then ise n to determine the friction force: Fapp Ffric TTE Ffric N. This value will remain constant for the remainder of Part 1. 4. For the simulation portion of Part 1, you will use different value of applied force Fapp, as indicated in the below table. Trial Fnet 1 10 N 3.0 kg 21 20 N 3.0 kg 3 30 N 3.0 kg 4 40 N 3.0 kg 50 N 3.0 kg 6 60 N 3.0 kg 7 70 N 3.0 kg 8 80 N 3.0 kg 91 90 N 3.0 kg 10 | 100 N || 13.0 kg 5 For each trial: (i) Input the proper value of Fapp, then press rise to run the simulation. (ii) Calculate the acceleration a from the velocity-vs-time plot that is automatically generated. *We will be working in each dimension independently for the rest of this lab, so boldface letters for force will be replaced with italics. 3 \r\n(iii) Be sure every column in the row is filled before moving to the next trial. (iv) Repeat until every trial is complete. 5. Create a plot of the net force versus the acceleration, as shown in Figure 2. Apply a linear fit 100 data - linear fit 80 60 Net Force N 40 20 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Acceleration m/s? Figure 2: Net force versus acceleration. A linear fit has been added to the data trendline to your plot. If you're using Excel or something similar, have the software display the trendline equation. It should display in slope-intercept form: y = mx +b. What is your slope value? slope = 6. The value of the slope should be almost exactly equal to a quantity you were given earlier. What quantity? Show/explain why this makes sense. 4 \r\nPART 2: Questions 1. Consider a 5.0-kg box that is pushed rightward by an applied force of 20 N. The friction coefficient between the box and the floor is j = 0.5. What is the acceleration of the box? Start by drawing a free-body diagram. 2. An explosion occurs that sends a 15-kg crate skidding (without rotation) across the level floor of a factory at an initial speed of 10 m/s. The crate travels 50 meters in 5 seconds before coming to rest. What is the friction coefficient pe between the floor and the crate? (Hint: Use equations (1) and (2), as well as an equation from Chapter 3's lecture slides.) 5 ", "contentHash": null}, "stats": null, "userHostAddress": null, "course": null, "legacyId": 52379576, "id": "d134dff8-0d3b-476d-b85a-847b5d24407b", "expirationDate": "2020-06-19T19:36:00Z", "availableAnswerTemplates": ["HTML_ONLY"], "lastUpdatedBy": null, "comments": [], "postType": null, "author": {"firstName": null, "lastName": null, "displayName": "Anonymous", "nickName": null, "name": "", "id": "105641364", "profileImage": {"postTargets": null, "mediaType": null, "id": null, "uri": null}, "type": "user"}, "questionState": "AnsweredAndUnrated", "editable": false, "resources": null, "tags": null, "lastUpdatedDate": "2020-06-19T17:56:09Z", "createdDate": "2020-06-19T15:36:00Z", "geoLocation": null, "createdBy": null, "rewardInfo": {"offered": 300.0, "rewarded": 0.0, "status": "Debited"}, "answerCreatedDate": "2020-06-19T17:56:08Z", "anonymous": true, "status": "Open", "statistics": {"answerCount": 1, "searchCount": 0, "viewCount": 0, "editCount": 0, "commentCount": 0}}}, "669e98a4-bf37-46e8-a1a8-4b7c632866ff": {"httpCode": 200, "errors": [], "result": {"bookInfo": null, "subject": {"name": null, "id": 204}, "rating": null, "answers": [], "privacy": "Public", "moderationStatus": "None", "source": {"metadata": null, "sourceType": "CheggWebsite", "id": null}, "title": "Question in Advanced Physics", "content": {"previewImages": null, "templateName": "STUDENT_QUESTION", "mediaType": null, "textContent": "A vacuum chamber has the following gases: 20% oxygen, 60% of nitrogen and 10% of argon and 10% of Hydrogen.

You are to do this without writing anything to the HTML file, you can only work in the JavaScript file. I will use Firefox to look at the DOM of your page after your JavaScript is run. What I see should look exactly like the goal file (with the exception of white space and the script line at the bottom). Try to write as few lines as possible. Be clever about how you access DOM elements. Store references to things that will be used more than once. You have access to all the techniques we've learned up until now and you may use them. Loops, conditional statements, and arrays all may come in handy. Note: This assignment has an extra credit component. To earn extra credit points you must first earn a perfect score on the assignment. Requirements You must use all of the various techniques used in the lesson to manipulate the DOM. You will need to set properties of referenced DOM nodes such as textContent, etc. There are many DOM element properties that you are able to set. You are not limited to just the items I showed. You may use other DOM methods that you look up providing you provide a reference in the comments of your code to the URL or resource where you found the method described. At minimum you must include these DOM methods: createElement createTextNode appendChild removeChild insertBefore The first image is the fixer.js and have to work on.

An engineer has used a voltmeter to supply the voltage and measures the current to calculate the above measurement's resistance and relate it to pressure measurement. iii. The voltmeter resolution is 0.1mA. If the pressure changes from 760 torr to 0.1 torr, the temperature changes from 30\u00b0C to 10\u00b0C and, the corresponding resistance change is exponential with the temperature (resistance decrease with the decrease in temperature).

To keep calculations simple we will work with a random sample of 500 respondents from the ANES dataset. The distribution of responses are as follows:  Region: According to the 2010 Census, 18% of US residents live in the Northeast, 22% live in the North Central region, 37% live in the South, and 23% live in the West. Evaluate whether the ANES sample is representative of the population distribution of US residents. Make sure to clearly state the hypotheses, check conditions, calculate the appropriate test statistic and the p-value, and make your conclusion in context of the data. Also comment on what your conclusion says about whether or not this sample can be considered to be representative.  Region and direction:  We would like to evaluate the relationship between region and feeling about the country's direction. What is the response variable and what is the explanatory variable?

Calculating the debt to GDP ratio Suppose the following statistics characterize the financial health of the hypothetical economy Spendia at the end of 2017: . Gross domestic product (GDP) is equal to $200 billion. \u2022 The national debt is equal to $240 billion. \u2022 The government has a budget deficit of $8 billion. \u2022 The debt ceiling in Spendia is set at $259 billion. The following calculations help you see how the ratio of debt to GDP changes from one year to the next. Complete the first row of the following table by computing the ratio of national debt to GDP. Suppose that nominal GDP remains at $200 billion in 2018, and again the government runs a budget deficit of $8 billion. For simplicity, assume the interest rate on the national debt is 0%, and no payments are being made to reduce the debt. Calculate national debt and the debt-to-GDP ratio in 2018. Enter these values in the second row of the following table. GDP (Billions of dollars) Year 2017 National Debt (Billions of dollars) 240 Ratio of National Debt to GDP 1.20 200 2018 200 Now that the government's national debt has been growing for several years, investors have become worried that the government might default on its debt-that is, might refuse to pay back the investors. As a result, the investors are now willing to lend to the government only if they receive an interest rate of 20%. If the government runs a budget deficit of $10 billion in 2019, the national debt will increase by $ billion. True or False: At the end of 2019, the government of Spendia will exceed the legal limit on how much it can borrow.

If you have two tasks x and y, with y being a successor to x, if x is marked as \"undone\" as it needs to be redone, then also y will need to be redone, as it might use the results of x. To implement this, we will perform two modifications. First, we will endow our scheduler with a redo method, which marks a task and all its successors to be redone.

Matt must decide whether to lay off 20% of the company's employees due to declining revenues. Matt wants you to help him make the best decision possible.

In the following table, identify the order in which these steps are usually taken. Order Decision-Making Steps Identify the alternatives. Evaluate the results. Select the best alternative. Evaluate the alternatives. Define the decision situation. Implement the chosen alternative. After you reviewed the six steps with Matt, he asked for an example of how to evaluate alternatives as he decides whether VoxSigns should lay off employees. Which of the following is the correct example to give to Matt? Even though it is a difficult decision, Matt would decide that VoxSigns should lay off employees as the best way to address the company's immediate need for cash. Matt would assess each option in terms of feasibility, satisfactoriness, and consequences; he will want to consider if the company is capable of implementing each option, as well as the resulting financial returns and other consequences (such as lower employee morale for remaining employees). O Matt would make a list of ways the company might address its financial concerns, such as laying off employees, increasing customer prices, moving to a less expensive office space, or a combination of these ideas. O Matt would articulate the specific issue to be decided: whether laying off employees is the best way for VoxSigns to address the financial pressure it faces. Although Matt likes the structure provided by the rational decision-making process, you caution him that it has some shortcomings. Given the assumptions of the rational decision-making model, why is this process difficult to apply completely in many situations? Check all that apply. Managers may lack the resources to explore creative solutions. Managers often make decisions that are not based on facts and logic. Managers do not always evaluate situations logically. Managers usually have time to research new and novel alternatives. \r\nAlthough Matt likes the structure provided by the rational decision-making process, you caution him that it has some shortcomings.

Based on the absorbance spectrum, what is the peak absorbance wavelength for PNP? (0.5pt) 4. Now that you have an estimation of the peak absorbance wavelength for PNP, you want to refine this value (i.e. get a more precise measurement). Briefly (1-2 sentences) describe how you would accomplish this. (0.5pt) 5. Using Excel or Google Sheets, plot the absorbance data presented in the table below (Table 2) as a scatter plot to generate an absorbance vs. concentration standard curve. After plotting the data, add a linear trendline and generate the equation of the line.

During that time, the kid that delivers newspapers continued to deliver them in the usual manner: that is. flung about all around Reeborg's house. Finally one morning Reeborg decided he was well enough to get out of bed and pick up all the newspapers that were on his property. YOUR TASK: Program Reeborg to leave his house and pick up all the newspapers (beepers) that are on the perimeter of his property. Reeborg should then deposit all but one of these beepers in the vestibule of his house and then return to bed with the one beeper. Retaining that beeper in his pocket, he should face west and turn off. SITUATION DETAILS: In the initial situation, Reeborg is in his bed fac- ing some unknown direction. His bed is defined to be the extreme southwest corner of his house, vestibule excluded. The vestibule is a single corner that juts out from his house and has a one corner wide entrance to the house of one end and an exit on the other. The vestibule is walled on the other two sides. Reeborg's house is a rectangle guaranteed to be at least two corners high and wide. Except for the vestibule walls, there are no protusions or obstacles on the perimeter of the rectangle. There are no obstacles within the house. If any beepers are inside the house, they are to be ignored. Reeborg's property line includes only those corners that lie on the perimeter of his house. That is, only those corners that are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to the walls of his house. This includes corners adjacent to the vestibule. More than one paper may have fallen on the same street corner. There will always be at least one paper on the perimeter. Ignore papers that are not on Reeborg's \r\nStreeto \u263a \u263a Avenue \r\nproperty. Reeborg's property will never be restricted in such a way as to make it impossible for Reeborg to make a complete circuit around his property. CRITICAL OBSERVATIONS: This assignment is meant to exercise YOUR ability to design programs; neither offer nor accept any additional help, except on a one-to-one basis with the instructor (or TA). Remember the Academic Honesty pledge you signed earlier in the semester. This, and future assign- ments, are subject to automated plagiarism scanning (typically using Moss) as well as special grader scrutiny and peer review. IMPLEMENTATION NOTES: . There is NO starter file for this assignment. \u2022 Use as your source file name \"clearpapers.py\". \u2022 Only one turn off() may be used and that one must be located in the main routine. Don't forget to include the title line and global comments at the top of your program Use comments in front of your functions to clarify the purpose of the function. \u2022 This is a \"Classic Reeborg\" assignment; use only the Python technology you learned in items #1 through #17 of the \"Reeborg the Robot Programming Summary\" \u2022 Do NOT use any variables. \u2022 Do NOT use any compound predicates, that is no ANDs or ORs. \u2022 Do NOT use any recursive procedure calls, that is, no functions call themselves.

The program will read in the id number and the won-lost record of a baseball team. It will compute various things about the team, and it will print everything out. Then it will repeat the process for a new team, over and over again, until the entire set of data has been taken care of. At the end, it will print the number of teams. Here are the details: 1. The program will read in the id number of a team (see step 5 below). The program will read in the number of wins this team has and the number of losses. For example, the program could read in the following three pieces of data-and it will print everything read in: 1234 5 7 [this says team 1234 has 5 wins, 7 losses] 2. The program will compute (and print) the total number of games played, which is simply the number of wins plus the number of losses. The program will also print the number of games remaining in the season, which is 25 minus the total number of games played. If the total number of games played is exactly 25, the program will print a message saying the season is finished. If the total is less than 25, the program will print how many games are remaining in the season. You can assume that no team has played more than 25 games (see optional 3 below). For example, for the team shown above, the total number of games played is 12, and there are 13 games remaining (25 - 12 = 13). 3. The program will compute the team's winning average, which is a decimal value between 0 and 1. The winning average is defined to be the number of games won divided by the total number of games played. For the team shown above, the winning average is 5 /12 = 0.4167. The program should print this out as shown above, with exactly 4 decimal places. 4. The program will compare the number of games remaining to both the number of games won and the number of games lost, printing two separate messages-one for each comparison. (Each question below must have a single message printed for it.) First, the program will determine whether or not the number of games remaining is greater than or equal to the number won. Print an appropriate message in either case. Then the program will determine whether or not the number of games remaining is greater than the number lost, it will print an appropriate message in either case. \r\nNote that these two questions are questions\u2014if possible, use my phra se two questions are not the same. And note carefully the phrasing of the two possible, use my phrasing. You must test all of the four possible ations of yes/no answers to these questions - see below. Then the program should skip a few lines of output and repeat the entire series of steps for the next team, and so on, until the last team has been processed. You must decide how to recognize that the last team has been processed. 6. At that point, print the total number of teams in the league, then stop. DATA: Read in data for at least 8-10 teams. Make sure that at least three teams have completed their season, and at least five have not. Have at least three teams with more wins than losses, at least two with an even record, and at least three with more losses than wins. Have a team with the number of wins equal to the number remaining, and have a team with the number of losses equal to the number remaining. Have a team with all wins, and have a team with all losses. (You may read data interactively or from a file. If you use an external file, print and hand in a copy of the data.) Make sure that every possible path is covered by a set of data. Here is a complete set of output for a typical team: team 9867 4 wins 12 losses total number of games played is 16 9 games remaining the winning average is 0.2500 number of games remaining is greater than or equal to number won number of games remaining is not greater than number lost OPTIONALS: 1. For each team that has not completed the season, compute the team's record if it wins all of the remaining games (give the won-lost record and the winning average). and the record if it loses all of the remaining games. 2. Keep track of the team with the best winning average that is not exactly 1. Print this out at the end. Do the same just for those teams that have completed their season. 3. If a team has completed more than 25 games, print an error message, ask the user to type in new data (repeat if necessary). Do NOT process the original set of data.

Title Comment Block i. Create your source code file named main.cpp, and at the very top of the source code use three one line comments to document your name, date, and the exercise, using the following format: Name: Stephen May Date: 02/08/2021 Exercise: Labe Solution 2. Write a C++ program that performs as a Tuffy Titan Height Calculator which prompts the user for the name of a person and his/her height in feet and inches, where the name can contain spaces. Your program should allow unlimited number of inputs and should finish the input cycle when the user types xxx when prompted for the name. Your program should store each user input data into a file for later processing, where the name, feet, and inches are each on a separate line. Once the user types xxx, your program should read in the file and print out a report listing the name, feet, inches, centimeters, and meters of each person, where the centimeters and meters are calculated based on the user input. Your program should use the prompt and output formats exactly as provided in the samples output below. Note: Using the pwd command at the terminal command prompt will display the path of the current directory. Note: Opening a write file with no modes specified will clear its contents. Note: Opening a write file in append mode will allow previous data to be retained. 3. Compile the file using the command below. The -std option tells the compiler that it will use C++ version 17 standards and the -o main option tells the compiler to place the executable code into a file called main. clang++ -std=C++17 main.cpp -o main 4. Run the program using the command below and repeat the steps above until you are satisfied your program output meets the above requirements. I strongly suggest that you run your program using each of the sample outputs below and ensure that all blank lines and new lines are exactly as below. Note that there are 2 blank lines between amount inserted and the dispensed or error output. ./main \r\n5.

You will create a method that asks a quiz question and a method that checks the answer, and you will use those methods to ask multiple questions.

These instructions assume that you are using the Eclipse IDE on your own computer or you may use a different Java environment as long as you can provide Java code and screen shots for your assignment submission. First open your previous Programming Assignment in Eclipse, with the file \"Quiz.java\" in the editor pane. \u2022 Add a static method that asks a question until the user provides valid input. \u2022 Call the method \"ask\". It should take a String parameter, and it should return a String. static String ask(String question) { \u2022 Remember where method definitions go: inside the class (in this case, \"Quiz\") but outside all other method definitions (like \"main\"). It can go before or after the \"main\" definition. \u2022 Ask the user the question repeatedly until the user provides a valid answer: \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", or \"E\". \u2022 Ask the question using \"JOptionPane.showInputDialog\". \u2022 Allow the user to provide a lower-case answer, and convert it to upper case. \u2022 If the user provides an invalid answer, use \"JOptionPane.showMessageDialog\" to tell them, \"Invalid answer. Please enter A, B, C, D, or E.\" Then ask the question again. Repeat until the answer is valid. \u2022 Once the user provides a valid answer, return that answer (converted to upper case). \u2022 Notice that the method does not check whether the answer is correct. It just asks the same question until the answer is valid. Try out your new method. \u2022 Delete the existing loop from your main method, but leave the initialization of the question String. \u2022 Call the \"ask\" method with your question String as the argument (actual parameter). \u2022 Note that you do not have to use the String returned by \"ask\". \u2022 Run your program. It should keep asking the question until you provide a valid answer. It does not yet check the answer. \u2022 Try invalid and valid answers. Now add a method that asks questions using \"ask\" and checks answers. \u2022 Call the method \"check\". It should take two String parameters. static void check(String question, String correctAnswer) { \u2022 The method definition can go before, after, or between the definitions for \"ask\" and \"main\", but it must be inside the \"Quiz\" class and outside the other method definitions. \u2022 In the \"check\" method, call \"ask\" to get a valid answer. String answer = ask(question); \u2022 If the answer is correct, use \"JOptionPane.showMessageDialog\" to report, \"Correct!\" \u2022 If the answer is incorrect, use \"JOptionPane.showMessageDialog\" to report, \"Incorrect. The correct answer is .\" This output should include the actual correct answer. Test the \"check\" method. \u2022 Replace the \"ask\" call in the main method with a \"check\" call. You will need to provide both the question String and the answer String as arguments. \u2022 Run your program. It should keep asking the question until you provide a valid answer. Then it should tell you if your answer is correct. \u2022 Try invalid, incorrect, and correct answers. Add more questions. \u2022 In the main method, call \"check\" with at least two more unique quiz questions, each with a different correct answer, for a total of at least three questions. \u2022 You may either declare and initialize new local variables or reassign the existing question variable after each \"check\" call. \u2022 Run your program. Make sure the responses work as expected for all the questions. Finally, add a score for the quiz. \u2022 Add two static member variables, one for the number of questions and one for the number of correct answers. Initialize them to zero for good documentation. static int nQuestions = 0; static int nCorrect = 0; \u2022 Remember where member variables go: inside a class definition but outside all method definitions. You may declare the variables before, after, or between the existing methods. \u2022 In the \"check\" method, increment \"nQuestions\" each time it is called. \u2022 Also in the \"check\" method, increment \"nCorrect\" for each correct answer. \u2022 Display the score at the end of the main method using \"JOptionPane.showMessageDialog\". Use the text, \" correct out of questions\", with the appropriate numbers. \u2022 Run your program. Make sure it displays the right numbers of questions and correct answers.

It should\nkeep asking the question until you provide a valid answer. It does\nnot yet check the answer. \u2022 Try invalid and valid answers. Now add\na method that asks questions using \"ask\" and checks answers. \u2022 Call\nthe method \"check\". It should take two String parameters. static\nvoid check(String question, String correctAnswer) { \u2022 The method\ndefinition can go before, after, or between the definitions for\n\"ask\" and \"main\", but it must be inside the \"Quiz\" class and\noutside the other method definitions. \u2022 In the \"check\" method, call\n\"ask\" to get a valid answer. String answer = ask(question); \u2022 If\nthe answer is correct, use \"JOptionPane.showMessageDialog\" to\nreport, \"Correct!\" \u2022 If the answer is incorrect, use\n\"JOptionPane.showMessageDialog\" to report, \"Incorrect. The correct\nanswer is .\" This output should include the actual correct answer.\nTest the \"check\" method. \u2022 Replace the \"ask\" call in the main\nmethod with a \"check\" call. You will need to provide both the\nquestion String and the answer String as arguments. \u2022 Run your\nprogram. It should keep asking the question until you provide a\nvalid answer. Then it should tell you if your answer is correct. \u2022\nTry invalid, incorrect, and correct answers. Add more questions. \u2022\nIn the main method, call \"check\" with at least two more unique quiz\nquestions, each with a different correct answer, for a total of at\nleast three questions. \u2022 You may either declare and initialize new\nlocal variables or reassign the existing question variable after\neach \"check\" call. \u2022 Run your program. Make sure the responses work\nas expected for all the questions. Finally, add a score for the\nquiz. \u2022 Add two static member variables, one for the number of\nquestions and one for the number of correct answers. Initialize\nthem to zero for good documentation. static int nQuestions = 0;\nstatic int nCorrect = 0; \u2022 Remember where member variables go:\ninside a class definition but outside all method definitions. You\nmay declare the variables before, after, or between the existing\nmethods. \u2022 In the \"check\" method, increment \"nQuestions\" each time\nit is called. \u2022 Also in the \"check\" method, increment \"nCorrect\"\nfor each correct answer. \u2022 Display the score at the end of the main\nmethod using \"JOptionPane.showMessageDialog\". Use the text, \"\ncorrect out of questions\", with the appropriate numbers. \u2022 Run your\nprogram.

Before two monsters can fight, we need to give two new class methods that update their stats. Implement a method for \u201cwin_fight\u201d and \u201close_fight\u201d. Win_fight should add 5 to the monster\u2019s self.exp, and reset their current_hp to their max_hp. Lose_fight should also reset their hp, but only adds 1 exp to self.exp. Now write a function that takes two instances of the Monster class as its input and makes them \u201cfight\u201d. A fight goes as follows: The monster entered as the first function parameter always goes first. Each monster takes a turn using one attack move. Loop over all attacks from most powerful to least powerful attack until there is a winner. If there is a tie in hit points for an attack select using alphabetical order. An attack is always successful and decreases the opponent\u2019s current_hp by the given number of points. Monsters continue taking turns until one of them reaches current_hp less than or equal to 0, at which point the win_fight and lose_fight methods should be invoked. Once the fight is complete, return the round number in which the fight ended, the monster that won and the list of attacks the winning monster used. If both monsters only have \u201cwait\u201d as an attack, return -1, None, None Sample Input 1: a = Monster(\"a\", 9)\nb = Monster(\"b\",

Case Study - Part One: Meet the Fields Scene: Your team has just arrived at the Fields farm, about 45 minutes northwest of the Minneapolis and Saint Paul metropolitan area... Hello, and welcome to our family farm. My name is Josephine Fields, and for the next several weeks, you will be working for us. Are we ever glad to have you here! As you know, we've hired your consulting firm because you came highly recommended by your previous clients. It seems that you know just what to do to turn around small businesses that are struggling to stay afloat. So, let me fill you in on who we are and what we do here. As I said, my name is Josephine, though everyone calls me Josie, and I'm the youngest of three sisters. Veronica (42) is the oldest, then Johanna (35), and then me. I've lived on this farm for 32 years, my whole life. In fact, I was born upstairs in that room there, do you see it? It's the window closest to us here on the porch, with the white lace curtains. My mother refuses to let us replace those curtains. They were here when she was born, and she would tell you that her grandmother gazed out the same curtains as she gave birth to her children, many decades ago. The porch we are sitting on is part of the original farm house, built in 1875 by my great-great-great- great grandparents. Our long-time employee, Earl, keeps the farm house on a strict maintenance schedule. He insists this is a historical treasure and he cannot accept any deterioration whatsoever. Earl keeps an upper bedroom suite for himself, but other than him, no one lives here now. We do use the farm house for office space and meetings, and a place for employees to take breaks. Eight of the \r\nbedrooms are unoccupied with much of the original furniture still onsite, and we rooms for overnight guests. It's ver vernight guests. It's very peaceful here which is probably why we have so many and we occasionally use the we have so many visitors! You might be impressed to know that this piece of property has b pressed to know that this piece of paperty has been in our family for nearly 150 years. It wasn't long after this state was founded that our great-great-great-great gram purchased 160 acres for the bargain price of only $1.25 an acre. Our family has passe daughters of each generation until today where it belongs to my sisters and me. My mo running the business affairs up until about 2009, but she decided to re essaltairs up until about 2009, but she decided to retire early and move to Florida with dad. They'd had enough of the cold weather and enough in their bank account, I guess ur family has passed the farm to the I belongs to my sisters and me. My mother was The kitchen here in the farm house was uncraded several years ago by my mother, and the cooking in it. My grandmother wrote a wonderful Fields family cookbook with recipes s Benerations old, and I try to prepare homemade meals and desserts for staff and friends wheneve can. My grandmother always joked that a well-fed staff is a happy staff, and I have to say her. several years ago by my mother, and I do most of amily cookbook with recipes several ave to say I agree with What exactly is our business, you ask? Well, for many decades our family worked this purposes of local sustenance: selling wheat potatoes and corn on a small scale and raising both chickens and cattle, until the great depression hit and the family couldn't collect enough money locally to stay afloat. In response to this my great-grandmother had the idea to focus mostly on com and cattle so that they could take advantage of core competencies and keep overhead costs as low as possible. She really was a visionary leader and wrote a strategic plan that included being the first farm in the area to sell our corn in large orders to the city mills. This is what we continue with today -- our farm runs almost exclusively by raising cattle and growing corn, though this has been more difficult in recent years, which is why we're meeting with you today. I'll tell you more about that in a while. Nowadays it is Veronica who could be called the chief executive officer, as she took that baton from our mother and great-grandmother. She has a master's degree in business administration, and she's very serious about making sure our business continues to operate as it should. I've heard her ream into men twice her size, especially when it comes to the important stuff like corn prices. When she's at work, she means business, and she's always at work, so she always means business! When I call Veronica the chief executive officer, I mean that only informally. We've never really had a formal leadership structure, though when you talk with Johanna, she'll tell you why she thinks that is a mistake, especially because there's no clear accountability structure. Johanna informally handles the human resources for our family business and is in charge of all hiring decisions, personnel issues, and payroll. Though she has a degree in human resources management, we tease her that human resources is her specialty because she has so many children! She and her husband Teev already have four children under the age of seven, with another on the way. Teev, Johanna's husband, is Hmong American and he's worked here, for Earl, since graduating from college with a degree in agriculture science. He and Johanna began dating shortly after he came to work here, and the rest they say, is history. They plant several personal gardens on the west side of the property near their home, growing traditional Hmong herbs as well as many vegetables. Teev especially likes to tinker with plants that aren't usually found in our northern climate, and he's been able to grow some very unique plants. We have tried to talk him into finding a market for some of his more exotic vegetables and herbs, but he says he doesn't have time for that not with the way that the cattle and corn keep us all busy. Teev's parents live with them too, and his mother is the most amazing cook you'll ever meet, apart from my late grandmother of course. Teev's mother is quite the family \r\ne.

I don't mind. I love to keep bus ere, I took some college courses after high school, but I really felt out of place in the up moving home and helping on the farm. I guess you could say I'm still that person Tamm -if it needs to get done, and it doesn't fit under anyone else's job description, to me. I don't mind. I love to keep busy and there's no place I'd rather be anyhow. I have apartment in town but have often thought about moving back into the farm house: often thought about moving back into the farm house. Both of my meir families have homes near the farm. Maybe when Earl retires I'll take his bedroom sisters and their families have homes near the farm suite. built in 2004, il of them in prily get-togeneakers, and De do use we wire fun wo sorty, here I am rambling on. So, let's see you had asked me about the buildings onsite? Well, have a beautiful newer barn on our property, bu cautiful newer barn on our property, built in 2004. as well as five other outbuildings used for vur farming operations and equipment. Earl and Teey keep all of them in pristine condition. Funny chough, we've never put animals into the new barn, but we do use it for family get-togethers and things. Johanna used it for her wedding in 2006 and it was a blast. We wired it up with speakers, and even purchased a removable dance floor for the occasion. It was such a big fun wedding that everyone teases I need to hurry up and find a partner so that we can host another wedding! All in good time, tell them. We also maintain three or four small historical-type structures on the property, such as the old red barn over there near the river. None of us has the heart to tear it down. There are also two field-hand cabins at the southern edge of the property, and an old hunting shack down by the river. The cattle use a 1950s milking barn closer to the rolling hills you see behind us, because then they are closer to the grazing pastures. We don't like to keep our animals cooped up, and also figure if we let them graze near the hills, it preserves our ability to go sledding in the winter. Several years ago, Earl built a make-shift tow rope for the kids. Every year we invite kids from the local elementary schools to come here for a day of sledding and lunch and we give them a tour of the farm. There's even a little pond at the base of the hills that freezes real nice for ice skating. Our winter visits from the school kids is one of my favorite activities, and if it were up to me, we'd host many more days like that. I'm in charge of organizing that event, and I even give tours in an old pair of my dad's overalls! I guess you could say I really play up the part. As you can see, most of the land up here near the farm house is used for our private gardens. In truth they are Veronica's gardens, and she has both her daughters helping her they are twins, Rachel and Rebecca, age 17. They grow pumpkins and squash, strawberries and tomatoes, cucumbers and beans, and honestly everything in between. Veronica's son Jack, who is 15, also helps in the garden, though you're more apt to find him and his dad Mark, Veronica's husband, down on the docks fishing. Yes, that's right. That is the Mississippi River and it stretches the whole eastern side of our property. Mark, who is quite the craftsman when he wants to be, built a beautiful wooden staircase leading down to the bank. He's a commercial fisherman and can't stay off the water for long. Along with his fishing boat, we also keep a pontoon on the dock for summertime family entertainment. The river is beautiful up here, mostly lined with trees and hills, and it makes for quite a peaceful afternoon drifting with the current. Anyhow, Earl thinks that Mark should give up the fishing and help him and Tee run the outdoor farm operations, but Mark's never seemed all that interested, so we let him be. Earl can be a bit grumpy at times, but he's a gentle soul so we don't take too much of what he has to say to heart. He loves the land, and he's dedicated to making any efforts at revitalizing this place a success. \r\nrate. A here on tin As for the business side of things, the daughters in our family have always we've really made it a family affair with aunts and uncles. cousins, nieces and place at the farm. Including ourselves 15 of our 25 employees are family members love working with family, but it hasn't always made it easy to manage our stall, par of our dillering management philosophies. I tend to think that the less micromanagi better off the business runs. However, my sisters both think we need to be tougher, productivity isn't where it was when our parents were running things. So where it was when our parents were running things. So I guess it depends on who you ask ily have always been in charge; however ousins, nieces and nephews all taking a ployees are family members. Of course we e it easy to manage our staff, particularly because ink that the less micromanagement we do, the the generous donations our family made to I suppose you are wondering why we would w you are wondering why we would be interested in changing our business model at all. I sa Valid question, because for many years our family business was wildly successful. In fact, you can sul see our influence in town-for example, the fields Library and the Fields Elementary School I those projects were both named in honor of the generous donations our family made to the town and those proje in particular. Being gentle to our land and mindful of our resources has been important to us, and as you can see, we have a wind turbine on the back comer of our land. It powers all of our larm operations, and we've benefited a great deal by selling our excess power back to the utility company. guess you could say we've always had an eye toward social resensibility and we would want to make sure that it continues. As far as environmental sustainability is concerned, we haven't tried any organic Tarming, but it sure isn't out of the question in my opinion As Bob Dylan wrote, the times, they are a- changin' Perhaps though, our reasons for change are more compelling than Bob Dylan lyrics. You see, with the economic downturn in 2008, we have found ourselves in a difficult financial situation, and just simply unable to compete with the large commercial farming that now dominates the agricultural industry. Though it has been painful to realize that something needs to change here, we are feeling that, once again, we must reinvent our family farm, as our great grandmother did so many decades ago. To put it more bluntly, Veronica says that the farm won't survive another decade under our current business model. So, after many late-night family discussions, we are prepared to sell our cattle and our com equipment in order to fund a new business opportunity. Earl says our cattle business would be worth about $350,000 at auction and our com operations are probably worth more, maybe as much as $750,000. We don't need you to be concerned about finances specifically, but we do need you to keep your business ideas within reason. For example, no need to propose something enormous like building a hotel and waterpark complex. Si million can go fast, so please do remember that we're running a small business here at the Fields farm. On the topic of finances, I must also tell you about our previous bookkeeper, though it is quite embarrassing for us. This particular bookkeeper had worked here for many years, and unfortunately. mismanaged some of our funds. Mostly, he was not forthright with the fact that our income was not keeping up with our expenses, and he dipped into our personal cushion that our family had saved in ander to weather the bad years. Veronica views his dishonesty as a breach of business ethics, and is pow managing the books herself. We do want to turn the job over to a professional eventually, but we are nervous about this, given our experience. Maybe a code of ethics would help? I'm just not sure. Ultimately, we want more than anything to keep this land in the family, even though, as you can see, etropolitan development is creeping in all around us. Just this past winter, a new housing project approved across the road running the length of our land that puts 350 single-family homes within walking distance of our front gates. There is also a park and another school being built near us that in a prime location to attract renewed attention to our farm, but here's the problem, us sisters aree with how we should use these factors to our advantage. This is where you come in. As long also a park and that puts car, a new he th how we should attract repe \r\nas you can help us reinvent our business, we can continue to operate. As long as we are profitable within five years, we will be able to survive. have with regard to a new business been some of our agricultural roots mo Most importantly, we are open to any new business ideas, if it can be accomplished here on this land. because none of us plans to leave anytime soon. In other words, we want to hear any ideas you might have with regard to a new business idea for our family. We know you are not experts in farming.no do you need to be. While we would like to keep some of our agricultural roots intact, we aren't afraid of trying something new. In fact, after so many years of working cattle and corn, we are excited about a change. Especially all of the grandchildren, who are willing and ready to take over the business from us sisters one day. re excited about Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll need to get back to my own work now. I have 16 girlfriends staying over this weekend for a canning party. We take over the farm house and have a great time all weekend. I have old family recipes that create the most deliciously spiced concoctions you've ever tasted. I'll even send you home with these iars of our apple cobbler filling. We have about su appie trees at the top of the hills, and the apples were wonderful this past year.... Thanks for your help and we'll see you again in a few weeks!

A sealed cylindrical balloon of initial height h=1.0 m and radius r=1.0 m contains gaseous hydrogen H2 at a pressure of 2.0 bar. The balloon is initially in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings and is subsequently subjected to two heating processes. In process 1-2, the gas inside the balloon is slowly heated so that its temperature increases by 100K, but the balloon does not significantly change its dimensions during this process. In process 2-3 however, further heating results in the slow inflation of the balloon to final dimensions h=2.0 m and r=1.0 m. The balloon remains cylindrical in shape during inflation and the volume occupied by the hydrogen is governed by the formula V =arh. The internal pressure p is found to be proportional to hW412 during process 2-3. The processes take place at ground level in a standard atmosphere at temperature T. = 288 K and pressure po = 1 bar. It can be assumed that the gas behaves like an ideal gas satisfying the state equation pv = RT with R = 4.157 kJ/kgK, where v is specific volume and T is absolute temperature. (a) Determine the volume occupied by the system of H2 gas in its initial state. [5 marks] (b) Determine the mass of the system of H2 gas in the balloon.

If the mass has just enough speed to make it around the loop without leaving the track, what is its speed at the final flat level (19.1 m off the ground)? 5. Now a spring with spring constant k = 18500 N/m is used on the final flat surface to stop the mass. How far does the spring compress? 6. It turns out the engineers designing the loop-the-loop didn\ufffd&frac12;t really know physics \ufffd&frac12; when they made the ride, the first drop was only as high as the top of the loop-the-loop. To account for the mistake, they decided to give the mass an initial velocity right at the beginning. How fast do they need to push the mass at the beginning (now at a height equal to the top of the loop-the-loop) to get the mass around the loop-the-loop without falling off the track? 7. The work done by the normal force on the mass (during the initial fall) is: a. Positive b. Negative c.

The gene! that you'll track codes for a protein in the species' venom. \u2022 The DNA sequence you'll track contains 10 nitrogen bases. You can choose the order of the bases and where the mutations occur. \u2022 This gene mutates at a rate of approximately 0.76 base pairs every 17.1 million years. To build your model, calculate the estimated time period it takes for 1 base pair to mutate. \u2022 The first time period will only show the common ancestor. At the beginning of the second time period, three lineages will diverge from the common ancestor each with a different mutation in their gene sequences. The first and third descendant species will survive for the rest of the timeline. The second descendant species was extinct 50 million years ago.

The\nsuspensions should be as identical as possible so that the puffs hang at the same height.\n5. Tape your test puff rod to the edge of a table or counter several inches from one edge.

The puffs should be centered on the thread 3. Select one puff to be your test puff, and the other to be your charge source. Pull the thread tight at the base of the test puff, and stab the needle through the puff so that it creates a straight pointer at the puff's bottom (Step 3a). Use the 20-cm piece of thread to tie scissors to the second puff (Step 3b). Attach both puffs to long rods (chopsticks, kabob sticks, or mixing spoons are fine) to form bi-fiber suspensions as shown (Final Setup). The suspensions should be as identical as possible so that the puffs hang at the same height. 5. Tape your test puff rod to the edge of a table or counter several inches from one edge. Place a bright light straight in front of the puff so that the puff casts a sharp shadow on the surface behind it. Tape a ruler to that surface such that the shadow from the needle touches the 0 on the ruler. 6. Tape a second ruler to the surface behind the puff so that its 0 end is lined up with the rod on the test pufftrod. (See Final Setup). 7. Use a heavy book to hold the source rod in place. Initially, separate the two rods by about 20 cm 8. Charge the puffs by rubbing them with fur, hair, wool, or some other electron source 9. After you have charged both puffs, you should notice that the test puffs needle's shadow no longer lines up with \"0 on the ruler. Record the shadow's new position as well as the separation between the two rods. Move the charge source pufftrod progressively closer to the test pufftrod, and repeat step 9 after each move. Your two rods should be about 1- cm apart for your last measurement. Charge can discharge (\"evaporate\") from your puffs (especially on humid days), so you will need to work 10. ikkly When you are done with the initial measurements, you may want to verify that your puffs haven't discharged too much.

Next, take a moment to familiarize yourself with how to build a basic logic circuit in OrCAD. The simplest way is to make a 5V and a OV rail to simulate a digital high and a digital low signal as inputs to your logic gates. You can place the parts below by going to Place>PSpice Component>Digital>Gates. The output of each gate is an off-page connector. Create a transient analysis simulation that will run for 2ms and run it. You can see the output of your logic circuit without doing any more complex simulations, just turn on your bias point display after you run your simulation by selecting PSpice>Bias Points>'Enable Bias Voltage Display'. V2 OVDE BV Figure 1. Simulated AND Gate Question: What is a digital high and a digital low in a real circuit? Reduce the 5V DC input voltage in steps of 0.5V down to 0.5V and run your simulation each time.

Next, take a moment to familiarize yourself with how to build a basic logic circuit in OrCAD. The simplest way is to make a 5V and a OV rail to simulate a digital high and a digital low signal as inputs to your logic gates. You can place the parts below by going to Place>PSpice Component>Digital>Gates. The output of each gate is an off-page connector. Create a transient analysis simulation that will run for 2ms and run it. You can see the output of your logic circuit without doing any more complex simulations, just turn on your bias point display after you run your simulation by selecting PSpice>Bias Points>Enable Bias Voltage Display . Figure 1. Simulated AND Gate Question: What is a digital high and a digital low in a real circuit? Reduce the 5V DC input voltage in steps of 0.5V down to 0.5V and run your simulation each time. Note when you see a change in the output of your bias point display and explain what you think is happening. Choose another gate from the truth table above and confirm its behavior in OrCAD and include a screenshot in your lab report. \r\nWe can do better than the above circuit. In order to create a more compact circuit that we can do more data analysis with, we are going to use the VPULSE part that we were introduced to in the previous lab. A reminder on how this part works is shown in Figure 2 below. TF TR TF TR PW PW Vi PER PER Figure 2. V Pulse Parameters in OrCAD In this case, we want to simulate our signals for inputs A and B to match our truth table above. As we can see in Figure 3 and Figure 4 below, input signal A will give us OV for the first millisecond, have a negligible rise and fall time, and then have a high pulse width for 1millisecond. Input signal B will have a delay of 0.5milliseconds, and then pulse for another half of a millisecond, and repeat.

The finish line is at space 50, and the first animal to reach or pass 50 wins the race and the prize (a pail of fresh organic lettuce and carrots). In this program, the course is up the side of a slippery mountain, so the animals can occasionally lose ground. Each animal has specific move types that correspond to their movement in the course. The animal, move type, probability of move type and actual move is shown in the table below: Animal Tortoise Hare Move Type Fast Plod Slip Slow Plod Sleep Big Hop Big Slip Small Hop Small Slip Probability of Move 50% 20% 30% 20% 20% 10% 30% 20% Actual Move 3 spaces forward 5 spaces backward 1 space forward No movement 7 spaces forward 10 spaces backward 1 space forward 2 spaces backward The race is managed by a 'clock' (loop) that ticks once per 'second' (iteration). While the race has not been won, your program should adjust the position of the tortoise and the hare on the course, with each tick of the clock (i.e., iteration in the loop). The race (i.e., loop) ends when one or both of the animals reaches the 50th space. The program should use variables to keep track of the animal's positions between 1 and 50). If an animal slips at the start of the race, move the animal back to position 1. Similarly, if an animal advances past the finish line, rest the position to 50. The movements of each animal should be controlled by a function that accepts one argument and returns one value. The value passed to the function should represent an initial or current position in the race, and the value returned should represent the animal's new position in the race. Use a random number generator to simulate the movements passed on their probability. A random number should be generated for each animal within the range 1 < num < 10. \r\nExample: For the tortoise, a random integer in the range 1 num < 5 should result in a fast plod (as that movement will occur 50% of the time). Similarly, a random integer in the range 65 num 37 should result in a slip, and a random integer in the range 8 5 num < 10 should produce a slow plod. Use the same technique to randomize the movements of the hare. The randomization process should be part of the function that governs the animal's movements. The program should include another function that accepts the variables of the tortoise and the hare. This function will not return any values, instead it will print output to show race progress. To do this use have a loop that spans the range of the course to determine which animal is in the lead, as well as print spaces to show progress. For each iteration, use the characters 'H' and 'T' to show where the Hare and the Tortoise are on the course. (Compare the loop control variable to the animal's variables to determine who is in the lead.) If the Tortoise and the Hare happen to be on the same space, the Tortoise will bite the Hare! (Interestingly enough, biting your opponent does not disqualify the Tortoise.) In that case, print \"OW!!\" on the screen. Once the loop stops, determine the winner of the race. If the value in Tortoise's variable is greater than or equal to the value in the Hare's variable, then the Tortoise wins (Yes, the Tortoise wins in the event of a tie, as the Hare is convinced that a tie is statistically unlikely.) Otherwise, the Hare wins. In each case, print out a message to indicate the winner of the race, as well as the number of iterations it took to complete the race. Sample output The output below shows possible outcomes of the race. Your results may vary. \r\nSample output The output below shows possible outcomes of the race. Your results may vary.

The person who was the navigator for Assignment 4 must be the driver for this assignment. If the same person ends up being the driver or navigator for both Assignment 4 and 5, then the pairs will receive a 20 point deduction. \u2022 Note that the races can end very quickly! Keep in mind that a second is represented by an iteration and is not an actual second. You will need at least four functions: A function to control the tortoise's movements A function to control the hare's movements A function to print race progress The main function to organize your code You are welcome to create more if you think it will help with organization.

Like the gravitational interaction, it has an infinite range 1 unlike the gravitational interaction where there is only one kind of mass, and the interaction is always attractive there are two kinds of electrical charge and the force can be either attract or repulsive. The electrostatic force between point charges is proportional to the product of the charges and falls off inversely with the square of the separation between the charges. This true for spherically symmetric distributions of charge when the separation between their centers is much larger than the radius of the charge distribution. This relationship was determini quantitatively by Charles Augustine de Coulomb in 1785 and is known as Coulomb's law. where the Coulomb constant, has a value of about 9x109 Nm/C2. It takes 6.2*10'electrons to create a single Coulomb of chargel (1 electron has a charge of 16'10\" In this activity you will test the Coulomb inverse square law for two charged Styrofoam puffs\" (sometimes called packing peanuts) and calculate the amount of charge on these puffs in your experimental setup, you will suspend a charged packing peanut from thread. Before you start the procedure, consider what should happen initially, the charged packing peanu dangles straight down due to gravity. If an object with the same charge is brought near the puff, it will swing around from the charged source until the Coulomb force and gravity are balanced In this new configuration, the puff is balanced between tension () from the string holding it up, gravity ng pulling it down, and the electrostatic force (FCoulomb) pushing its deways. The vertical y component forces balance to mg - Tcs (9.1) And the horizontal component forces balance to \r\nmg = Tcos....(E9.1) And the horizontal x-component forces balance to: Fcoulomb - Tsing...(Eq. 2) You can solve for the Coulomb force by dividing Eq. 2 by Eq. 1: F Tsine mg Toose - mgtan e [E4, 3] For small angles tane - sine (since for small angles y L) Equation 3 becomes F -m (44.41 Now the Coulomb force is given by F-99 where is the distance to a second puff off to the right; thus 1990ms 164,5) Equation 5 shows that the displacement of the poff, x, is inversely proportional tor \r\n\u2022 Ruler \u2022 A single Sheet of Graph-paper Lab Procedure 1. Cut two 80-cm lengths of thread and one 20-cm length of thread. 2. Using the needle, string an 80-cm piece of thread through each puff as shown. The puffs should be centered on the thread. 3. Select one puff to be your test puff, and the other to be your charge source. Pull the thread tight at the base of the test puff, and stab the needle through the puff so that it creates a straight pointer at the puff's bottom (Step 3a). Use the 20-cm piece of thread to the scissors to the second puff (Step 3b), 4.

Attach both puffs to long rods (chopsticks, kabob sticks, or mixing spoons are fine) to form bi-fiber suspensions as shown (Final Setup). The suspensions should be as identical as possible so that the puffs hang at the same height. 5. Tape your test puff rod to the edge of a table or counter several inches from one edge. Place a bright light straight in front of the puff so that the puff casts a sharp shadow on the surface behind it. Tape a ruler to that surface such that the shadow from the needle touches the 0 on the ruler. 6. Tape a second ruler to the surface behind the puff so that its end is lined up with the rod on the test pufferod. (See Final Setup). 7. Use a heavy book to hold the source rod in place. Initially, separate the two rods by about 20 cm. 8. Charge the puffs by rubbing them with fur, hair, wool, or some other electron source 9. After you have charged both puffs, you should notice that the test puff's needle's shadow no longer lines up with on the ruler. Record the shadow's new position as well as the separation between the two rods. 10. Move the charge source pufftrod progressively closer to the test pufferod, and repeat step after each move.

You can use the numbers you have recorded to glean a quantitative understanding of how the two puffs repelled one another. From the earlier discussion, we know the square of the separation is related to the displacement of the test puff: *99 = mg 20 64.5] 13. Plot x versu Wr. Include error bars. Note, plotting x versus 1/\" means that is plotted on the vertical axsis and W? is plotted on the horizontal axisis. Try to draw a straight line that passes through all of your data points (the line should pass through the error bar associated with each data point not the point itself). 14. Equation 5 can be written into the standard form for a straight line y-mx.b with b -0. x KQ, therefore the slope of the line, m, equal KQQ Since you charged the two puffs the same way, it is reasonable to assume they have equal amounts of charge on them, or 0, 0, 50 0.0, 02 slope - 0 54.5] 15. What is the value of the slope of your line? Be sure to include units. The slope of the line is related to the amount of charge on the pults. You can measure L and look up and k. We have measured a handful of puffs and needles and determined puffs have average weight of 0.05 0.05 grams. Filling these value into the equation above, solve for Q. What is the charge on each pur? How many electrons did each pull take from the fur or half you used as an electron source? Does this number seem suprisingly large or small to you, considering the effects you observed due to the electrostatic change? \r\nCoulomb's Law: Report Sheet 1. You can verify that the puffs didn't discharge too much because when moving test puff cach time at a certain distance, the movement from its position of the test puff would be the same, which will cause the charges to be the same. The charges will be the same when moving away or towards the test puff each time. 2./3.

After you are done with the initial measurements in other words, have completed Step #10), how would you verify that your puffs haven't discharged too much? 2. During the experiment, you qualitatively measured how one charged puff moves in response to a charged source. You can now use the numbers you have recorded to glean a quantitative understanding of how the two puffs repelled one another. From the earlier discussion in the lab, we know the square of the separation is related to the displacement of the test puff: kQ Q2/r2 = mgx/L 1/a x {Equation 5} 3. Plot x versus 1/r? Try to draw a straight line that passes through all your data points (the line should pass through the error bar associated with each data point, not the point itself) 4. Write equations in the standard form for a straight line y = mx +b with b 5. Verify that the slope m of this line equals LkQIQ3/mg. 6. Since you have charged the two puff in the same away, it is reasonable to assume that they have the same amounts of charge on them or Q1-Q2. So Q.Q2 - Q? Therefore, slope = L kQ+/mg (Eq5) 7. What is the value of the slope of your line? Be sure to include units. This slope is related to the amount of charge on the puffs. You should measure L and verify the values of g and k from references. For the mass of the pufis and the sewing needle, assume an average of 0.05+0.01 grams and 0.12.02 grams respectively 8. Solve for Q using these values in Equation 5. What is the charge on each puff? 9. How many electrons did each puff take from the hair or fur you used as an electron source? 10. Does this number seem surprising large or small to you? Why or why not?

Consider a time-invariant linar dynamical system with n-vector state and m-vector input e, with dynamies The entries of the state often represent deviations of quantities from their desired values, so x1 0 is a goal in operation of the system. The entries of the input ut are deviations fron the standard or nominal values. For example, in an aircraft model, the states might be the deviation from the desired altitude, climb rate, speed, and angle of attack; the input ue represents changes in the control surface angles or engine thrust from their normal values. In state feedback control, the states are measured and the input is a lincar function of the state, uK The mx n matrix K is called the state feedback gain matriz. The state foedback gain matrix is very carefully designed, using several methods. State feedback control is very widely used in many application areas (including, for example, control of airplanes) 16 (a) Open and closed-loop dynamical syste.

Consider a time-invariant linar dynamical system with n-vector state and m-vector input e, with dynamies The entries of the state often represent deviations of quantities from their desired values, so x1 0 is a goal in operation of the system. The entries of the input ut are deviations fron the standard or nominal values. For example, in an aircraft model, the states might be the deviation from the desired altitude, climb rate, speed, and angle of attack; the input ue represents changes in the control surface angles or engine thrust from their normal values. In state feedback control, the states are measured and the input is a lincar function of the state, uK The mx n matrix K is called the state feedback gain matriz. The state foedback gain matrix is very carefully designed, using several methods. State feedback control is very widely used in many application areas (including, for example, control of airplanes) 16 (a) Open and closed-loop dynamical syste. With u0, the system satisfies Are for t1,2,.., which is called the open-loop dynamics. WhenKrt, the system dynamics can be expressed as?1+1 = Azi, fr I = 1, 2, , where the n \u00d7 n matrix A is the closed-loop dynamics matriz Find an expression for in terms of A.

That means instead of 10 numerical digits (called decimal or base 10 format), computers only used two digits (either 0 or 1) to represent a positive integer. For example, 1210 will be represented as 11002 in a computer. This assignment requires you to write a java program using command line argument to acquire any positive integer less than 231 -1 and output it binary representation. Also acquire any unsigned binary (up to 31 bits) from the console and output it decimal representation. Instructions For this assignment, you must use String class to store the positive decimal and unsigned binary from the command line arguments. Create a class Lab04 with a main()method, and a decimalTobinary() method to convert positive decimal to binary, a binaryTodecimal()method to convert unsigned binary to positive decimal. In the main() method, you need to pass a string to the conversion methods, the string stores the command line argument (positive decimal and unsigned binary) after complete the conversion, both method return a string which contain the unsigned binary and positive decimal respectively. Write your own implementation of the conversions and decimalTobinary() has to be implemented with the shift and & or | operators on bits. Your main() method then output the result to the console. A program template as follow: public static void main(String[] args) { String d_s = new String(); // stores the decimal conversion result String b_s = new String(); // stores the binary conversion result . . . b_s = decimalTobinary(decimalString); // decimalString from command argument d_s = binaryTodecimal(binaryString); // binaryString from command argument . . . // your output code here; } public static String decimalTobinary(String decimal) { . . . // your positive decimal to unsigned binary code here . . . } public static String binaryTodecimal(String binary) { . . . // your unsigned binary to positive decimal code here . . . }", "content": "<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>Computers store positive integers using binary (base 2) format.\nThat means instead of 10 numerical digits (called decimal or base\n10 format), computers only used two digits (either 0 or 1) to\nrepresent a positive integer.

That means instead of 10 numerical digits (called decimal or base 10 format), computers only used two digits (either 0 or 1) to represent a positive integer. For example, 1210 will be represented as 11002 in a computer. This assignment requires you to write a java program using command line argument to acquire any positive integer less than 231 -1 and output it binary representation. Also acquire any unsigned binary (up to 31 bits) from the console and output it decimal representation. Following figure shows how to convert an unsigned decimal to its binary format (this conversation will be further discussed in the class). Note: You need to get the command line arguments as character strings (both decimal and binary) validate their format and then convert them to binary and decimal strings respectively. Instructions You must use String class to store the positive decimal and unsigned binary from the command line arguments. Create a class Lab04 with a main() method, and a decimalTobinary() method to convert positive decimal string to binary string, a binaryTodecimal()method to convert unsigned binary string to positive decimal string. In the main() method, you need to pass a string to the conversion methods, the string stores the command line argument (positive decimal string and unsigned binary string) after complete the conversion, both method return a string which contain the unsigned binary string and positive decimal string respectively. Your main() method then output the result to the console. A program template as follow: public static void main(String[] args) {\n String d_s = new String(); // stores the decimal conversion result String b_s = new String(); // stores the binary conversion result ... b_s = decimalTobinary(decimalString); // decimalString from command argument d_s = binaryTodecimal(binaryString); // binaryString from command argument ...   // your output code here;\n}\n public static String decimalTobinary(String decimal) { ...   // your positive decimal to unsigned binary code here\n ... } public static String binaryTodecimal(String binary) { ...   // your unsigned binary to positive decimal code here\n ... } Specifications Your program must meet the following specifications: Work on your own. The name of the source code file must be exactly Lab04.java Name it exactly: upper/lower case letters are important! Comments at the top with your name, e-Name (e-mail), date, course number, and short description of the program. Your program need to be able to convert unsigned binary up to 31 bit to positive decimal as well as convert positive decimal number up to 231 - 1 to unsigned binary. The output format must exactly match the example shown above, including blank line, white space and capitalization.

Determine the elevation for a flow rate of 6 Ls. SOLUTION The flow rate through a piping system connecting two reservoirs is given. The elevation of the source is to be determined. Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The elevations of the reservoirs remain constant. 3 There are no pumps or turbines in the line. Properties The density and dynamic viscosity of water at 10\u00b0C are p = 999.7 kg/m and - 1.307 x 10-3 kg/m.s. The roughness of cast iron pipe is -0.00026 m (Table 8-2). Analysis The piping system involves 89 m of piping, a sharp-edged entrance (K-0.5), two standard flanged elbows (K-0.3 each), a fully open gate valve (K = 0.2), and a submerged exit (K = 1.06). We choose points 1 and 2 at the free surfaces of the two reservoirs. Noting that the fluid at both points is open to the atmosphere and thus R = P = Patr) and that the fluid velocities at both points are nearly zero (VV-0), the energy equation for a control volume between these two points simplifies to + - 25 + 2 = + 2 + 2. = 2 + PS PS where H - - + since the diameter of the piping system is constant.

Find the k closest points to the origin, (0,0). (Here, the distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean distance.) You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in.) Example 1 Input: points = [[1,3], [\u20132,2]], k = 1 Output: [[\u20132, 2]] Explanation: The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is v10. The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is V8. \r\nSince V8 < 10, (-2,2) is closer to the origin. We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [(-2, 2]]. Example 2 Input: points = [(3, 3), (5, -1], [-2, 4]], k = 2 Output: [[3, 3), (-2, 4]] (The answer [1\u20132, 4), (3, 3]] would also be accepted.) It is important that you solve this problem using divide and conquer. That is, you have to reduce the original problem into one or more subproblems, recursively solve the subproblems, and then combine the solutions to obtain the solution to the original problem. Your solution should take O(n) time in the worst case. Note that you cannot use sorting, as this will take O(n log n) time. Note that the LeetCode webpage may accept a solution that is not O(n) in the worst case. By contrast, we require the solution to be O(n) in the worst case. Additionally, some solutions on Leet Code do not use divide and conquer. These are not acceptable solutions. Some solutions posted may also be wrong. In any case, a solution that is largely copied from another source (e.g., verbatim or made to look different by simply changing variable names) will be in violation of the Academic Honesty Policy. The following must be submitted. (a) Writeup (50 Points) \u2022 Pseudocode for your solution, with an explanation in words why your solution works. (25 points) Analysis, showing the correctness of your algorithm and its complexity (i.e., its runtime). (25 points). (b) Source Code (50 Points) \u2022 Write your solution in Python, C, C++, Java, or JavaScript. \u2022 Your code should be well written and well commented. \u2022 A comment with a link to your Leet Code profile (e.g., https://leetcode.com/jane-doe/) and a statement of whether or not your code was accepted by LeetCode. We will verify whether your code is accepted. \u2022 We must be able to directly copy and paste your code into LeetCode at the Leet Code problem page. If your code does not compile on LeetCode, it will will receive zero points. Under no circumstances will we attempt to modify any submission, so be sure the code you submit works.

The MATLAB expo function can be used to compute real or complex exponentials. By default, MATLAB uses the symbol \" to indicate the imaginary part (the equivalent of the \"i\" that EE's are more used to). Thus, el is represented in MATLAB as exp(i*w) where \"w\" is the normalized frequency in radians. Similarly, e' is represented in MATLAB as exp(-ikw), where \"K\" is a constant and \"w\" is the normalized frequency in radians. MATLAB uses \"i\" by default, but \"\" will also work. Thus, exp(- ik*w) and exp(-jk'w) are equivalent expressions in MATLAB. Note that \"i\" and \")\" are both actually MATLAB variables predefined to be equal to the square root of -1. If you set i=7 or 1-42 in your code (i.e. use i and/or j as array index counters or something) they will no longer be equal to the square root of -1 and thus further complex math may fail. THUS, avoid using either \"i\" or \"j\" for anything other than their predefined value of the square root of -1. 2. MATLAB has special operators for performing point by point scalar multiplication or scalar division for two vectors of the same size. For example, if A=[8 18] and B-12 31. then the simple expressions A B or A/B would indicate performing vector multiplication (producing an error in the example) or vector division (producing a scalar in the example). If what you want to do is multiply or divide individual values in the vectors, element by element, then use the \".\" and \"/\" versions of the operators. In the example, A. B-[16. 54] while A./B=[4 6). 3. The MATLAB audioread() function can be used to input data from a Windows standard format\".wav\" sound file: [x, fs] =audioread('mywavefile.wav\"); Note that x gets the sound data from the wave file and fs gets the sampling rate of the digitized sound (samples per second). 4. You can play the wave file through the PC sound system from the MATLAB environment using the sound function: sound(x, fs); 5. Assuming that \"x\" is the signal read above, and \"fs\" is the sampling rate, you can plot the entire time function with the horizontal axis scaled to seconds, using: t = (0:length(x)-1) /fs; plot(t, x); Note that while it is proper to use \"stem(\" to display discrete time signals, it is usually necessary to use plot if you are plotting a very large number of data points, as is the case in this assignment. If you try \r\nlot the estimate of using \"stem\" to plota complete signal with very many time steps, all of the si confusing mess. above, and \"fs\" is the same DET) with the horizontal axis scaled 6. Assumine that \"x\" is the signal read above, and \"S\" is the sampling rate, you can plot the the Fourier spectrum (the estimate of the DTFT computed using the DFT) with the horizontal axi to frequency in Hz, using: plot( f. abs(f(x)) ); f-f (:length(x)-1)/ length(x): Consult the MATLAB help in order to understand the format of these useful commands. Assignment #6 Do the following in a single MATLAB.m file, with one section (cell) for each of the numbered parts of the assignment (see item #15 in the MATLAB information above). Integrate the results in a Word document and save it as a PDF file. Upload your .pdf document and your MATLAB .m file to the corresponding assignment page on Canvas before the date and time indicated on Canvas. Note: You can make your Word document more compact (and better organized) by creating tables of appropriate dimension in Word and then pasting your MATLAB plots into the individual table elements. Then you can better control how the plots are positioned on the page. In this assignment we will analyze the properties of a 4th order Butterworth band-reject IIR filter with stop band between w-0.16 pi and w=0.20 pi. The transfer function for this filter is given by: (2) - 0.9150 - 3.09622-1 + 4.44962-? - 3.09622-) + 0.91502-4 --- 1.0000 - 3.234 02-1 + 4.4421z-2 -2.9585z-) + 0.83722-4 You can get the coefficients for this 4th order Butterworth band-reject IIR filter directly in MATLAB using the expression [BA] = butter(2, [.16 .20], 'stop'); where B will be a vector of the numerator coefficients and A will be a vector of the denominator coefficients. \r\nUN LLU Her which you can use to her to an unput I filter coefficients in MATLAB's vector form. IN THE FOLLOWING TASKS DO NOT USE THE MATLAB \"FILTER\" FUNCTION!!! 1. The MATLAB \"plane\" function will plot the poles and zeros of an HC) transfer function. Use this to plot the poles and zeros of the given filter 2. Write MATLAB code in an M file which will compute the values of H(w), the filter frequency response for the H(z) above, from a vector w containing the frequency values at which you want to compute the frequency response. In this case, DO NOT USE THE FREQZ FUNCTION, rather use the fact that H(w) - H(z) evaluated at . Thus, in the above H(2), the term z becomes exploi*2*w), and so forth. Make sure that the MATLAB code for computing the frequency response is included in your report. You may need to keep help item W2 above in mind when dividing the numerator of H(w) by the denominator of H(w). Use your custom code to determine the frequency response of the filter at 1024 values of w evenly spaced between w- and w 2pi. Plot the magnitude of the frequency response versus w over the range w=0 and w 2pi 3. Write MATLAB code in an M file which will compute the values of y(n), the filter response, from any discrete time input sequence x(n), where the length of the computed output sequence y(n) is the same as the length of the input sequence x(n). You can assume that all internal states (previous inputs and outputs) of the IR filter start at value 0. DO NOT USE THE MATLAB \"FILTER\" FUNCTION! WRITE YOUR OWN MATLAB CODE BASED ON THE SAMPLE DATA EQUATION DESCRIBING THE IIR FILTER. Make sure the MATLAB code that you write for the filtering operation is included in your report. 4. Create a signal \"d(n)\" which contains the value 1 followed by 1023 zeros (d(n) is a vector of 1024 values). Obviously, d\u00edn) is the discrete time impulse function. Use your MATLAB filtering code to compute the first 1024 values of \"h(n)\", the filter's impulse response, from d(n) (in your filter code let x(n)=d(n) so that y(n)-h(n)). Plot the first 30 values of the impulse response h(n) in a stem plot. How could we make an FIR approximation to this IR Butterworth filter? Would this FIR filter be linear phase? 5. We know that the filter's frequency response H(w) -DIFT{h(n)}. so compute 1024 samples of H(w) using the 1024-point DFT{h(n)) (remember in MATLAB the DFT is computed using Mo). Plot the magnitude of H(w) versus w over the range w=0 and w 2pi. Compare this to the results from part 2. If it is not a good match there must be something wrong with your filter code. 6. In the next steps you will use the IIR filter implemented in part 3 to filter the data in the waveform audio file speech5.wav (available on Canvas with the assignment). In your MATLAB code, read in the file using audioreado. Load the waveform into the MATLAB variable named x and the sampling rate into a variable called fs. Play the waveform using sound(). Adjust the sound system volume (and tone if available) to get clear sounding speech. 7. Plot the entire signal x as a function of time. The time axis should be correctly calibrated in seconds. The magnitude axis should be adjusted to the range - 1.2 to 1.2. It is important to use this scaling for direct visual comparison of waveforms throughout the rest of this assignment. Label the axes correctly. \r\ne O to fs. Make the range 0 to fs. 8.

Label the axes correctly, etc. xis scaled to physical ound signal x and using 9. Re-plot the filter frequency response from part 2, this time with the frequency axis scaled to frequency rather than normalized frequency w, using the value of is from the sound signal x an the MATLAB axis scaling \"axis([O fs 01.20\". 10. Use your MATLAB filtering code from step 3 to compute the signal y, the filter's response to the input signal x from part 6. Play the audio waveform signal y using soundo. How does it sound compar to the sound quality in part 6? 11. Plot the entire signal y as a function of time. The time axis should be calibrated in seconds. The magnitude axis should be adjusted to the range - 1.2 to 1.2. It is important to use this scaling for direct visual comparison of waveforms. Label the axes correctly, etc. 12. Plot the estimated magnitude of the frequency spectrum of the filtered signal y over the range 0 to fs.

replacing LastFirst with your name. 0 2 On the Sales worksheet, enter a date function in cell C8 to calculate the number of years the first representative has worked for your company. Copy the function to the range C9:C20. 7 3 On the Sales worksheet, enter a nested function in cell J8 of the Bonus column to display the bonus amount. If the employee sold $200,000 or more (cell J2) AND is International (cell I4), he or she earns a 5% (cell J4) bonus on his or her total annual sales; otherwise, the representative earns 3% (cell J3) of his or her total annual sales. Use relative and mixed (or absolute) references correctly in the nested function. Copy the function from J8 to the range J9:J20. 7 4 Enter a nested lookup function in cell E4 that uses the cells E2 and E3 to return a specific sales record. For example, using the current data, you want the function to return the third quarter sales for Erica. 7 5 Click the Database worksheet tab and enter conditions in the Criteria Range for Domestic sales reps that made 240000 or more in sales. 4 6 Perform an advanced filter based on the criteria range. Set the filter to copy the new data to the range A22:G22. 8 7 In cell J7, enter a database function to calculate the number of reps meeting the criteria. 7 8 In cell J8, enter a database function to calculate the highest total sales for records meeting the criteria. 7 9 In cell J9, enter a database function to calculate the average sales for records meeting the criteria. 7 10 Click the Addition worksheet tab, and then insert a formula in cell E2 to calculate the loan amount based on the loan parameters. 4 11 In cell E5, enter a function to calculate the monthly payment. Modify the function to ensure that the result is a positive number. 5 12 In cell E6, enter a function to calculate the total interest paid after five payments. Modify the function to ensure that the result is a positive number. The formula will result in an error until the loan amortization table is completed. 7 13 In cell B11, create a relative reference to cell B7 and in cell C11, create a relative reference to cell E2. In cell C12, enter a relative reference to cell F11 and copy the formula to the range C13:C15. 4 14 In cell B12, insert a function to enter the payment date for the next month. Copy the function to the range B13:B15. 7 15 In cell D11, enter the financial function to calculate the interest paid for the first payment period. The result should be a positive value. 7 16 In cell E11, enter the financial function to calculate the principal payment for the first payment period. The result should be a positive value. 7 17 In cell F11, subtract the principal payment in cell E11 from the beginning balance in cell C11. Copy the functions and formulas from the range D11:F11 to the range D12:F15. 5 18 Save the file making sure the worksheets are in the following order: Sales, Database, and Addition. Close Excel.

You will calculate the number of years each representative has worked and each representative\u2019s bonus. In addition, you will create a nested lookup function to look up a person\u2019s name and particular quarter to identify the sales for that person. Next, you will perform advanced database filtering and use summary database functions. Finally, you will complete an amortization table to build a small addition to your office complex. Steps to Perform: Step Instructions Points Possible 1 Download and open the file named exploring_e07_grader_a1_Sales.xlsx, and then save the file as exploring_e07_grader_a1_Sales_LastFirst, replacing LastFirst with your name. 0 2 On the Sales worksheet, enter a date function in cell C8 to calculate the number of years the first representative has worked for your company. Copy the function to the range C9:C20. 7 3 On the Sales worksheet, enter a nested function in cell J8 of the Bonus column to display the bonus amount. If the employee sold $200,000 or more (cell J2) AND is International (cell I4), he or she earns a 5% (cell J4) bonus on his or her total annual sales; otherwise, the representative earns 3% (cell J3) of his or her total annual sales. Use relative and mixed (or absolute) references correctly in the nested function. Copy the function from J8 to the range J9:J20. 7 4 Enter a nested lookup function in cell E4 that uses the cells E2 and E3 to return a specific sales record. For example, using the current data, you want the function to return the third quarter sales for Erica. 7 5 Click the Database worksheet tab and enter conditions in the Criteria Range for Domestic sales reps that made 240000 or more in sales. 4 6 Perform an advanced filter based on the criteria range. Set the filter to copy the new data to the range A22:G22. 8 7 In cell J7, enter a database function to calculate the number of reps meeting the criteria. 7 8 In cell J8, enter a database function to calculate the highest total sales for records meeting the criteria. 7 9 In cell J9, enter a database function to calculate the average sales for records meeting the criteria. 7 10 Click the Addition worksheet tab, and then insert a formula in cell E2 to calculate the loan amount based on the loan parameters. 4 11 In cell E5, enter a function to calculate the monthly payment. Modify the function to ensure that the result is a positive number. 5 12 In cell E6, enter a function to calculate the total interest paid after five payments. Modify the function to ensure that the result is a positive number. 7 13 In cell B11, create a relative reference to cell B7 and in cell C11, create a relative reference to cell E2. In cell C12, enter a relative reference to cell F11 and copy the formula to the range C13:C15. 4 14 In cell B12, insert a function to enter the payment date for the next month. Copy the function to the range B13:B15. 7 15 In cell D11, enter the financial function to calculate the interest paid for the first payment period. The result should be a positive value. 7 16 In cell E11, enter the financial function to calculate the principal payment for the first payment period. The result should be a positive value. 7 17 In cell F11, subtract the principal payment in cell E11 from the beginning balance in cell C11.

The Grignard reaction is moisture sensitive. For this reason, the glassware used for the experiment has to be dried in an oven prior to assembly (see lab manual for more details about the reflux apparatus). 2. A drying tube was prepared using a small piece of cotton, then 1-2 cm of solid CaCl2, and finally another small piece of cotton (Figure 1). The drying tube was added to the condenser immediately after the condenser was removed from the oven. Figure 1 - Picture of the drying tube used for this experiment Preparation of the Grignard Reagent 3. In adry 50 mL round bottom flask were combined 1.2 g of magnesium turnings and 0.28g of iodine. 4. In a dry beaker, a solution of 2.7 mL of 1-bromo-4-tert-butylbenzene in about 20 mL of anhydrous diethyl ether was prepared. One half of this solution was added to the round bottom flask, and the resulting solution was gently swirled until the reddish color of iodine disappeared (indication that the reaction has begun). Bubbles rising from the magnesium were observed and the solvent started boiling (this reaction is exothermic and diethyl ether has a boiling point of 35\u00b0C!) 5. The remaining 1-bromo-4-tert-butylbenzene solution was then added to the reaction. The reaction was allowed to boil on its own, and once the boiling subsided, a hot water bath was used to continue the reflux for 25 minutes. During that time, the round bottom flask was swirled occasionally. At the end of the 25 minutes, the solution was dark brown, but clear \r\nReaction with Carbon Dioxide 6. In a clean beaker, 3.7 g of dry ice (solid carbon dioxide) were added. 7. The reaction flask was removed from the hot water bath, and once the flask reached room temperature, its contents were carefully transferred to the beaker containing the dry ice. \r\nIsolation of the product 8. To the resulting sticky mass obtained in step 7 was added approximately 20-30 g of ice, 25 mL of 2.5 M HC, and 15 mL of diethyl ether. 9. Once the ice has melted, the solution was transferred into a separatory funnel. The beaker was rinsed with 15 mL of diethyl ether and the rinsings were also added to the separatory funnel. 10. The layers were extracted and stored in separate containers. The aqueous phase was extracted a second time with 15 mL of diethyl ether and the organic extracts were combined. 11. A TLC of the organic layer using the stating material as the reference was taken. In your lab report, draw an exact replica of the TLC, calculate the Rt of all the spots, and provide a full analysis. Solvent system 1:9 EtoAc/Hexane Legend Ref. Starting Material Co - Co-Spot R-Organic Layer Figure 2-TLC of the Organic Phase and the Starting Material \r\n12. The combined organic phases were then extracted twice, each time with 20 ml of aqueous 10% NaOH solution. 13. The resulting aqueous extracts were combined and acidified in the fumehood by the dropwise addition of concentrated HCl until the solution was strongly acidic and no more precipitate was formed. The Erlenmeyer flask was cooled in an ice bath for 5 minutes, and the solid was collected via suction filtration. The solid was washed a few times with cold distilled water. 14. Once dry, the product was weighed, and 2.4 g were obtained, and its melting point was found to be 161-164\u00b0C. Calculate the yield of the reaction. Note that a flow chart for the extractions must be included in your lab report. Also, the mechanism should be drawn using the Chemdraw software. 15. A few crystals of the product obtained where dissolved in about 1 mL of dichloromethane, and a TLC of the final product using the starting material as the reference was taken. In your lab report, draw an exact replica of the TLC, calculate the Rs of all the spots, and provide a full analysis.

The overall rate of evolution will slow down to the point of being unobservable. As populations become more mixed, the rate of occurrence of new mutations will be reduced. Use the following passage to answer the next question. Flower color in sand blossoms (shown to the right, Linanthus parryae) is controlled largely by a single gene with two alleles, B and b. Individuals with genotype BB or Bb are blue, and individuals with genotype bb are white Sand blossoms grow in patches in the desert. Some patches of sand blossoms have only blue individuals, some have only white, and some are mixed. Based only on the information provided, which option below is a plausible explanation for the difference in sand blossom color among patches? The difference among patches is due to natural selection. Blue individuals have higher reproductive success in some patches, white plants have higher success in some patches, and the two colors do equally well in some patches. The difference among patches is due to the founder effect. Some patches were founded by homozygous blue individuals, some patches by white individuals, and some patches by individuals carrying both alleles. The difference among patches is due to genetic drift. Particularly if population size in a patch is small, one color or the other might be lost simply as a result of chance events, such as drought or disease. All of the above explanations are plausible.

Genetic control of biochemical reactions in Neurospora, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 27: 499-506. Early studies in biochemistry and medicine identified human genetic diseases caused by enzymes that are either missing or are defective in the affected individual. Researchers also recognized that there is a genetic component to these diseases, because family members of patients with these types of diseases are more likely to contract the disease than if they didn\u2019t have an affected family member. This information led scientists to believe that there may be a connection between genes and enzymes. A classic genetic research study was performed in an attempt to find evidence for this idea. In 1941, George Beadle and Edward Tatum, working at Stanford University, conducted a study of mutant strains of a fungus (Beadle and Tatum, 1941). The fungus they used was a common bread mold called Neurospora crassa. They created these mutant strains by exposing yeast spores to X-rays which can damage DNA. The mutant strains of Neurospora were then screened to identify any mutants that were unable to produce the amino acid arginine. The biochemical pathway for the production of arginine is shown in Figure 1. Each step of the pathway is catalyzed by a different enzyme (Enz E through Enz H) indicated above the arrow for each step of the pathway. Beadle and Tatum proposed that different mutations in the Neurospora strains would block different steps in the biochemical pathway by disabling the enzyme required for that step. The experimental method they used was to first identify mutant strains that were unable to grow unless arginine was supplied to them in the growth medium. Four different mutant strains were isolated. They then transferred these yeast strains to growth media containing nutritional supplements other than arginine to determine if any other supplement was sufficient to allow the mutant strain to grow. The other supplements they tested were the intermediates of the biochemical pathway for arginine synthesis. Specifically, they tested the ability of the Neurospora arginine mutants to grow when they were supplied with ornithine, citruline, and argininosuccinate. The results of these growth studies are shown in Figure 2. These results allowed Beadle and Tatum to identify which enzyme of the arginine biosynthetic pathway was defective in each of the four arginine mutants. From this work, Beadle and Tatum proposed the \u201cone gene-one enzyme\u201d hypothesis that we now call the \u201cone gene-one polypeptide\u201d hypothesis. In 1958, Beadle and Tatum received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their work. Beadle and Tatum hypothesized that Group of answer choices (pick one) 1. a mutation in a gene leads to the loss of function of a specific enzyme 2. mutant strains of Neurospora would not grow without arginine in the medium 3. DNA mutations result from defective enzymes in the arginine biosyhthesis pathway 4. X-rays are capable of damaging DNA The hypothesis of the experiment allowed Beadle and Tatum to predict that Group of answer choices (pick one) 1. growth of the mutants would be dependent on factors other than the supplements 2. a different supplement would be needed for the growth of each mutant strain 3. each mutant strain is the result of a different change in the DNA 4. supplementing the growth media with ornithine would allow all mutant strains to grow The independent variable of this experiment was Group of answer choices (pick one) 1. the nutritional supplements included in the growth medium 2. the use of X-rays to induce mutations in the DNA 3. the amount of growth of the mutant strain in each growth medium 4. the amount of arginine produced by the mutant strain Beadle and Tatum concluded that Group of answer choices (pick one) 1. all Neurospora strains require the addition of a nutritional supplement in the medium 2. only Neurospora mutant strains require nutritional supplements in the growth medium 3. enzymes only function properly when the correct nutritional supplement is present 4. each gene codes for the production of a specific enzyme While conducting this experiment, Beadle and Tatum assumed that Group of answer choices (pick one) 1. each mutant strain possessed only one mutation (only 1 change in its DNA) 2. inducing mutations with X-rays would produce mutations only in genes for enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway for arginine 3. mutant #2 possessed a mutation in the gene that encodes Enz G 4. additional mutations to the Neurospora strains would repair the original mutations The conclusion of this experiment implies that Group of answer choices (pick one) 1. Neurospora is a good organism for genetic studies 2. human diseases caused by defective enzymes are the result of mutations in specific genes 3. the addition of a nutritional supplement fixes the defect in the enzyme 4. providing nutritional supplements to mutants will correct for any mutation", "content": "<p>This is a summary of a research experiment that was published in\nthe following article:<br>\nBeadle, G. and Tatum, E. 1941.

APPARATUS Due to the online nature of this lab, the apparatus\" principally used is an online resource produced by PhET Interactive Simulations that can be found at PhET. BACKGROUND Velocity is the change in an object's position divided by the time interval spanned to yield that change. In the horizontal direction-the direction the average velocity can be written as A. (1) and in the vertical direction-the y direction the average velocity can be written as At Al (2) Notice that equations (1) and (2) are actually the same mathematical equation, but different symbols are used for convenience. In our case, the symbol r is used to denote the horizontal direction, and the symbol y is used to denote the vertical direction. But velocity is velocity, whether in the horizontal or vertical direction. Velocity is merely a definition. If you've taken algebra, you'll recognize the form of (1) and (2): the change in one quantity divided the by change in another quantity. What is this quotient typically called in a mathematics class? Slope. Therefore, we see that: Velocity is the slope of a position-versus-time graph. velocity change in position change in time slope Refer to Figure 1 for an illustration of this. Notice that a slope can be positive or negative. The sign of the velocity indicates the direction of the velocity. For example, consider that you are watching a car on the road. When it is going away from you, its velocity is positive. When it is coming toward you, its velocity is negative. Think about the reason why. The instantaneous velocity in the r-direction can be found by taking the limit: lim :(t + At) - (0) at 0 Similarly for the y-direction and any other direction This, of course, depends on how you define your coordinate frame. But, assuming you stand at the origin, the convention mentioned applies. \r\ny g Vyt Vys Figure 2: An object undergoing projectile motion. The length of the arrows denotes the magnitude of the vector in that direction. angle relative to the ground, we say that the object has a component, or piece, of its velocity in the direction (horizontal) and a component of its velocity in the y direction (vertical), which can be denoted as Uz, and ty, respectively. This is shown in Figure 2. As time progresses, the object moves forward and upward until it reaches its zenith, and then it continues to move forward and downward. The flip in vertical direction is caused by the downward tug of gravity, which accelerates the object toward the ground. Notice that the horizontal velocity remains constant throughout the motion. In other words, the initial velocity in the u direction is equal to the final velocity in the x direction. In equation form. This is because gravity acts only in the vertical direction, meaning that the horizontal direction expe riences no acceleration. This type of simple motion is known as projectile motion, which is motion experienced by an object in free fall. The equations of motion describing our specific scenario are as follows: Horizontal motion: and Vertical motion: yf = yi + vyt - 3yt. \r\nPART 1: Finding the Slope of Position 1. Open the PhET Interactive Simulation for projectile motion. A menu with four options will appear. Select the final option entitled \"Lab.\" Lab An interface will appear. Leave all of the variables at their default values. 2. Click on to launch a projectile. A blue parabolic curve will be traced out by the software, with points marked out at specific time intervals. 3. Open an Excel spreadsheet (or a Matlab script, Mathematica notebook, or any preferred plotting software). If using Excel, create three columns: one for time, range, and height. 4. Select the target scope, which is found in the upper right of the general PHet interface. Use Time Range Height this target scope to find the time, range (horizontal position), and height (vertical position) of every point along the curve by hovering the crosshair over each point. Record these values in the Excel spreadsheet you created. Do not record the single point where the object hits the ground. An example of what your table will look like is shown below. Time Range Height . 5. Create two scatter plots: (i) Horizontal position (range) versus time. \u00fc) Vertical position (height) versus time. Your plots should look similar to those seen in Figure 3. You must turn in your plots with the rest of this manual. \r\n10 Horizontal Position [m] 1 0 0.5 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 Time Is 20 15 Vertical Position [m] 10 5 0.5 2.5 3 3.5 Time Is Figure 3: Plots of position versus time. \r\n6. Based on the horizontal position-vs-time plot, is the horizontal speed constant throughout the object's motion? Explain how the plot supports your answer. 7. Based on the vertical position-vs-time plot, is the vertical speed constant throughout the object's motion? Explain how the plot supports your answer. 8. Pick two points on the horizontal position-vs-time plot. Using equation (1), calculate the velocity in the direction. Show your work. m/s. (i) Does the value you calculated represent the velocity through the entire trajectory? Explain your answer. 9. Pick two points on the vertical position-vs-time plot. Using equation (2), calculate the velocity in the y direction. Show your work. \r\n(1) Does the value you calculated represent the velocity through the entire trajectory? Explain your answer. \r\nPART 2: Finding the Slope of Velocity 1. Using the data you already collected and tabulated in the previous part, apply equations (1) and (2) to find the approximate velocity at points in time. It might be helpful to create a second table with three columns: time, velocity in the r direction, and velocity in the y direction. And example of what your table will look like is shown below. Time Horizontal Velocity Vertical Velocity 2. Using the new table you created, generate two scatter plots. The new plots should appear similar to Figure (4). You must turn in your plots with the rest of this manual Horizontal Velocity (m/s) 0.5 1.5 2.5 3 3.5 2 Time s 10 Vertical Velocity (m/s) -10 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 Times 2.5 3 Figure 4: Plots of velocity versus time. \r\n3.

Then label the axes while taking care to choose a sensible scale for your system. You should take into account that the minimum and maximum for both x and y are -20 units and +20 units, respectively. Also, determine how many centimeters correspond to the \u201cunit square\" of your chosen scale. (4) Draw vector A on the graph paper by treating the components as a coordinate pair (Ax, Ay). Draw a small dot at the location of (Ax, Ay). Draw a line from the origin to that dot - making the origin the location of the \u201ctail\" and the dot the location of the \u201ctip\" by drawing a little arrow symbol at the end of the line as it reaches (Ax, Ay). (5) Repeat the process for vector B. (6) Now, add the two vectors using the graphical \"tip-to-tail\u201d method. To depict the addition of vector B to vector A, use the tip of vector A as a new starting spot for a duplicate \"clone\" of vector B. To depict the addition of vector A to vector B, use the tip of vector B as a new starting spot for a duplicate \"clone\" of vector A. Your drawing should look very similar to what is depicted in Figure 4. (7) From your drawing, determine using a ruler and protractor the \u201cexperimental\u201d values for the magnitude, the quadrant reference angle, and the proper angle of the resultant vector R. Be sure to use the same scale that relates centimeters to your chosen \"unit square.\" (8) Return to the given components of vectors A and B and use the analytical method of vector addition to determine the \"known\" magnitude, quadrant reference angle, and proper angle for the resultant vector R. (9) Comment on the consistency of the results obtained in steps (7) and (8). Calculate percent differences to quantify your conclusions.

Hint: the asset beta of the whole company is just a weighted average of the asset betas of the divisions. This is based off of this case study: Marriott Corporation: The Cost of Capital (Abridged) In April 1988, Dan Cohrs, vice president of project finance at the Marriott Corporation, was preparing his annual recommendations for the hurdle rates at each of the firm\u2019s three divisions. Investment projects at Marriott were selected by discounting the appropriate cash flows by the appropriate hurdle rate for each division. In 1987, Marriott\u2019s sales grew by 24% and its return on equity (ROE) stood at 22%. Sales and earnings per share had doubled over the previous four years, and the operating strategy was aimed at continuing this trend. Marriott\u2019s 1987 annual report stated that: We intend to remain a premier growth company. This means aggressively developing appropriate opportunities within our chosen lines of business\u2014lodging, contract services, and related businesses. In each of these areas, our goal is to be the preferred employer, the preferred provider, and the most profitable company. Cohrs recognized that the divisional hurdle rates at Marriott would have a significant impact on the firm\u2019s financial and operating strategies. As a rule of thumb, increasing the hurdle rate by 1% (for example, from 12% to 12.12%), decreased the present value of project inflows by 1%. Because costs remained roughly fixed, these changes in the value of inflows translated into changes in the net present value of projects. Figure A shows the substantial impact of hurdle rates on the anticipated net present value of projects. If hurdle rates were to increase, Marriott\u2019s growth would be reduced as once profitable projects no longer met the hurdle rates. Conversely, if hurdle rates decreased, Marriott\u2019s growth would accelerate. Marriott also considered using the hurdle rates to determine incentive compensation. Annual incentive compensation constituted a significant portion of total compensation, ranging from 30% to 50% of base pay. Criteria for bonus awards depended on specific job responsibilities but often included the earnings level, the ability of managers to meet budgets, and overall corporate performance. There was some interest, however, in basing the incentive compensation, in part, on a comparison of the divisional return on net assets and the market-based divisional hurdle rate. The compensation plan would then reflect hurdle rates, making managers more sensitive to Marriott\u2019s financial strategy and capital market conditions. Company Background Marriott Corporation began in 1927 with J. Willard Marriott\u2019s root beer stand. Over the next 60 years, the business grew into one of the leading lodging and food service companies in the United States. Marriott\u2019s 1987 profits were $223 million on sales of $6.5 billion. See Exhibit 1 for a summary of Marriott\u2019s financial history. Marriott had three major lines of business: lodging, contract services, and restaurants. Exhibit 2 summarizes its line-of-business data. Lodging operations included 361 hotels, with more than 100,000 rooms in total. Hotels ranged from the full-service, high-quality Marriott hotels and suites to the moderately priced Fairfield Inn. Lodging generated 41% of 1987 sales and 51% of profits. Contract services provided food and services management to health-care and educational institutions and corporations. It also provided airline catering and airline services through its Marriott In-Flite Services and Host International operations. Contract services generated 46% of 1987 sales and 33% of profits. Marriott\u2019s restaurants included Bob\u2019s Big Boy, Roy Rogers, and Hot Shoppes. Restaurants provided 13% of 1987 sales and 16% of profits. Financial Strategy The four key elements of Marriott\u2019s financial strategy were: \u2022 Manage rather than own hotel assets; \u2022 Invest in projects that increase shareholder value; \u2022 Optimize the use of debt in the capital structure; and \u2022 Repurchase undervalued shares. Manage rather than own hotel assets In 1987, Marriott developed more than $1 billion worth of hotel properties, making it one of the ten largest commercial real estate developers in the United States. With a fully integrated development process, Marriott identified markets, created development plans, designed projects, and evaluated potential profitability. After development, the company sold the hotel assets to limited partners while retaining operating control as the general partner under a long-term management contract. Management fees typically equalled 3% of revenues plus 20% of the profits before depreciation and debt service. The 3% of revenues usually covered the overhead cost of managing the hotel. Marriott\u2019s 20% of profits before depreciation and debt service often required it to \u201cstand aside\u201d until investors earned a prespecified return. Marriott also guaranteed a portion of the partnership\u2019s debt. During 1987, three Marriott hotels and 70 Courtyard hotels were syndicated for $890 million. In total, the company operated about $7 billion worth of syndicated hotels. Invest in projects that increase shareholder value The company used discounted cash flow techniques to evaluate potential investments. The hurdle rate assigned to a specific project was based on market interest rates, project risk, and estimates of risk premiums. Cash flow forecasts incorporated standard companywide assumptions that instilled some consistency across projects. As one Marriott executive put it: Our projects are like a lot of similar little boxes. This similarity disciplines the pro forma analysis. There are corporate macro data on inflation, margins, project lives, terminal values, percent of sales required to remodel, and so on. Projects are audited throughout their lives to check and update these standard pro forma template assumptions. Divisional managers still have discretion over unit-specific assumptions, but they must conform to the corporate templates. Optimize the use of debt in the capital structure Marriott determined the amount of debt in its capital structure by focusing on its ability to service its debt. It used an interest coverage target instead of a target debt-to-equity ratio. In 1987, Marriott had about $2.5 billion of debt, 59% of its total capital. Repurchase undervalued shares Marriott regularly calculated a \u201cwarranted equity value\u201d for its common shares and was committed to repurchasing its stock whenever its market price fell substantially below that value. The warranted equity value was calculated by discounting the firm\u2019s equity cash flows by its equity cost of capital. It was checked by comparing Marriott\u2019s stock price with that of comparable companies using price/earnings ratios for each business and by valuing each business under alternative ownership structures, such as a leveraged buyout. Marriott had more confidence in its measure of warranted value than in the day-to-day market price of its stock. A gap between warranted value and market price, therefore, usually triggered repurchases instead of a revision in the warranted value by, for example, revising the hurdle rate. Furthermore, the company believed that repurchases of shares below warranted equity value were a better use of its cash flow and debt capacity than acquisitions or owning real estate. In 1987, Marriott repurchased 13.6 million shares of its common stock for $429 million. The Cost of Capital Marriott measured the opportunity cost of capital for investments of similar risk using the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) as: WACC = (1 - ?)r- (D/V) +r- (E/V) DE where D and E are the market value of the debt and equity, respectively, r -D is the pretax cost of debt, is the after-tax cost of equity, and V is the value of the firm. (V = D+E), and ? is the corporate tax rate. Marriott used this approach to determine the cost of capital for the corporation as a whole and E for each division. To determine the opportunity cost of capital, Marriott required three inputs: debt capacity, debt cost, and equity cost consistent with the amount of debt. The cost of capital varied across the three divisions because all three of the cost-of-capital inputs could differ for each division. The cost of capital for each division was updated annually. Debt capacity and the cost of debt Marriott applied its coverage-based financing policy to each of its divisions. It also determined for each division the fraction of debt that should be floating rate debt based on the sensitivity of the division\u2019s cash flows to interest rate changes. The interest rate on floating rate debt changed as interest rates changed. If cash flows increased as the interest rate increased, using floating rate debt expanded debt capacity. In April 1988, Marriott\u2019s unsecured debt was A-rated. As a high-quality corporate risk, Marriott could expect to pay a spread above the current government bond rates. It based the debt cost for each division on an estimate of the division\u2019s debt cost as an independent company. The spread between the debt rate and the government bond rate varied by division because of differences in risk. Table A provides the market value target leverage rates, the fraction of the debt at floating rate, the fraction at fixed rates, and the credit spread for Marriott as a whole and for each division. The credit spread was the debt rate premium above the government rate required to induce investors to lend money to Marriott. The cost of equity Because lodging assets, like hotels, had long useful lives, Marriott used the cost of long-term debt for its lodging cost-of-capital calculations. It used shorter-term debt as the cost of debt for its restaurant and contract services divisions because those assets had shorter useful lives. The cost of equity Marriott recognized that meeting its financial strategy of embarking only on projects that increased shareholder values meant that it had to use its shareholders\u2019 measure of equity costs. Marriott used the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) to estimate the cost of equity. The CAPM, originally developed by John Lintner and William Sharpe in the early 1960s, had gained wide acceptance among financial professionals. According to the CAPM, the cost of equity, or, equivalently, the expected return for equity, was determined as: expected return = r = riskless rate + beta * [risk premium] where the risk premium is the difference between the expected return on the market portfolio and the riskless rate. The key insight in the CAPM was that risk should be measured relative to a fully diversified portfolio of risky assets such as common stocks. The simple adage \u201cDon\u2019t put all your eggs in one basket\u201d dictated that investors could minimize their risks by holding assets in fully diversified portfolios. An asset\u2019s risk was not measured as its individual risk. Instead, the asset\u2019s contribution to the risk of a fully diversified or market portfolio was what mattered. This risk, usually called systematic risk, was measured by the beta coefficient. Betas could be calculated from historical data on common stock returns using simple linear regression analysis. Marriott\u2019s beta, calculated using five years of monthly stock returns was 1.11. Two problems limited the use of the historical estimates of beta in calculating the hurdle rates for projects. First, corporations generally had multiple lines of business. A company\u2019s beta, therefore, was a weighted average of the betas of its different lines of business. Second, leverage affected beta. Adding debt to a firm increased its equity beta even if the riskiness of the firm\u2019s assets remained unchanged, because the safest cash flows went to the debt holders. As debt increased, the cash flows remaining for stockholders became more risky. The historical beta of a firm, therefore, had to be interpreted and adjusted before it could be used as a project\u2019s beta, unless the project had the same risk and the same leverage as the firm overall. Exhibit 3 contains the beta, leverage, and other related information for Marriott and potentially comparable companies in the lodging and restaurant businesses. To select the appropriate risk premium to use in the hurdle rate calculations, Cohrs examined a variety of data on the stock and bond markets. Exhibit 4 provides historical information on the holding-period returns on government and corporate bonds and the S&P 500 Composite Index of common stocks. Holding-period returns were the returns realized by the security holder, including any cash payment (e.g., dividends for common stocks, coupons for bonds) received by the holder plus any capital gain or loss on the security. As examples, the 5.23% holding-period return for the S&P 500 Composite Index of common stocks in 1987 was the sum of the dividend yield of 3.20% and the capital gain of 2.03%. The -2.69% holding-period return for the index of long-term U.S. government bonds in 1987 was the sum of the coupon yield of 7.96% and a capital gain of -10.65%.1 Exhibit 5 provides statistics on the spread between the S&P 500 Composite Returns and the holding-period returns on U.S. government bills, U.S. government bonds, and high-grade, long-term corporate bonds. Cohrs was concerned about the correct time interval to measure these averages, especially given the high returns and volatility of the bond markets shown in Exhibits 4 and 5. - - - - After reading the case answer this questions :", "content": "<html>\n <head></head>\n <body>\n  <p>Question: <strong>What is the WACC for Marriott\u2019s contract services division?

In 1987, Marriott had about $2.5 billion of debt, 59% of its total capital.</p> \n  <p>Repurchase undervalued shares Marriott regularly calculated a \u201cwarranted equity value\u201d for its common shares and was committed to repurchasing its stock whenever its market price fell substantially below that value. The warranted equity value was calculated by discounting the firm\u2019s equity cash flows by its equity cost of capital. It was checked by comparing Marriott\u2019s stock price with that of comparable companies using price/earnings ratios for each business and by valuing each business under alternative ownership structures, such as a leveraged buyout. Marriott had more confidence in its measure of warranted value than in the day-to-day market price of its stock. A gap between warranted value and market price, therefore, usually triggered repurchases instead of a revision in the warranted value by, for example, revising the hurdle rate. Furthermore, the company believed that repurchases of shares below warranted equity value were a better use of its cash flow and debt capacity than acquisitions or owning real estate. In 1987, Marriott repurchased 13.6 million shares of its common stock for $429 million.</p> \n  <p>&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>The Cost of Capital</p> \n  <p>Marriott measured the opportunity cost of capital for investments of similar risk using the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) as:</p> \n  <p>WACC = (1 - ?)r- (D/V) +r- (E/V) DE</p> \n  <p>where D and E are the market value of the debt and equity, respectively, r -D&nbsp;is the pretax cost of debt, is the after-tax cost of equity, and V is the value of the firm. (V = D+E), and ? is the corporate tax rate. Marriott used this approach to determine the cost of capital for the corporation as a whole and E</p> \n  <p>for each division.</p> \n  <p>To determine the opportunity cost of capital, Marriott required three inputs: debt capacity, debt cost, and equity cost consistent with the amount of debt. The cost of capital varied across the three divisions because all three of the cost-of-capital inputs could differ for each division. The cost of capital for each division was updated annually.</p> \n  <p>Debt capacity and the cost of debt Marriott applied its coverage-based financing policy to each of its divisions. It also determined for each division the fraction of debt that should be floating rate debt based on the sensitivity of the division\u2019s cash flows to interest rate changes. The interest rate on floating rate debt changed as interest rates changed. If cash flows increased as the interest rate increased, using floating rate debt expanded debt capacity.</p> \n  <p>In April 1988, Marriott\u2019s unsecured debt was A-rated. As a high-quality corporate risk, Marriott could expect to pay a spread above the current government bond rates. It based the debt cost for each division on an estimate of the division\u2019s debt cost as an independent company. The spread between the debt rate and the government bond rate varied by division because of differences in risk. Table A provides the market value target leverage rates, the fraction of the debt at floating rate, the fraction at fixed rates, and the credit spread for Marriott as a whole and for each division. The credit spread was the debt rate premium above the government rate required to induce investors to lend money to Marriott.</p> \n  <p>&nbsp;</p> \n  <p><img alt=\"Read the case then answer the 2 questions --M\" src=\"https://media.cheggcdn.com/media%2F9e7%2F9e7b5d5f-7406-47b5-bab4-ecccd2184adb%2Fimage\" style=\"height:auto;margin:0px;\" /></p> \n  <p>The cost of equity</p> \n  <p>Because lodging assets, like hotels, had long useful lives, Marriott used the cost of long-term debt for its lodging cost-of-capital calculations. It used shorter-term debt as the cost of debt for its restaurant and contract services divisions because those assets had shorter useful lives.</p> \n  <p>&nbsp;</p> \n  <p><img alt=\"Read the case then answer the 2 questions --M\" src=\"https://media.cheggcdn.com/media%2F20c%2F20c54351-ffcf-4d90-b70f-f8115b015b78%2Fimage\" style=\"height:auto;margin:0px;\" /></p> \n  <p>&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>The cost of equity Marriott recognized that meeting its financial strategy of embarking only on projects that increased shareholder values meant that it had to use its shareholders\u2019 measure of equity costs. Marriott used the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) to estimate the cost of equity. The CAPM, originally developed by John Lintner and William Sharpe in the early 1960s, had gained wide acceptance among financial professionals. According to the CAPM, the cost of equity, or, equivalently, the expected return for equity, was determined as:</p> \n  <p>expected return = r = riskless rate + beta * [risk premium]</p> \n  <p>where the risk premium is the difference between the expected return on the market portfolio and the riskless rate.</p> \n  <p>The key insight in the CAPM was that risk should be measured relative to a fully diversified portfolio of risky assets such as common stocks. The simple adage \u201cDon\u2019t put all your eggs in one basket\u201d dictated that investors could minimize their risks by holding assets in fully diversified portfolios. An asset\u2019s risk was not measured as its individual risk. Instead, the asset\u2019s contribution to the risk of a fully diversified or market portfolio was what mattered. This risk, usually called systematic risk, was measured by the beta coefficient.</p> \n  <p>Betas could be calculated from historical data on common stock returns using simple linear regression analysis. Marriott\u2019s beta, calculated using five years of monthly stock returns was 1.11.</p> \n  <p>Two problems limited the use of the historical estimates of beta in calculating the hurdle rates for projects. First, corporations generally had multiple lines of business. A company\u2019s beta, therefore, was a weighted average of the betas of its different lines of business. Second, leverage affected beta. Adding debt to a firm increased its equity beta even if the riskiness of the firm\u2019s assets remained unchanged, because the safest cash flows went to the debt holders. As debt increased, the cash flows remaining for stockholders became more risky. The historical beta of a firm, therefore, had to be interpreted and adjusted before it could be used as a project\u2019s beta, unless the project had the same risk and the same leverage as the firm overall.</p> \n  <p>Exhibit 3 contains the beta, leverage, and other related information for Marriott and potentially comparable companies in the lodging and restaurant businesses.</p> \n  <p>To select the appropriate risk premium to use in the hurdle rate calculations, Cohrs examined a variety of data on the stock and bond markets. Exhibit 4 provides historical information on the holding-period returns on government and corporate bonds and the S&amp;P 500 Composite Index of common stocks. Holding-period returns were the returns realized by the security holder, including any cash payment (e.g., dividends for common stocks, coupons for bonds) received by the holder plus any capital gain or loss on the security. As examples, the 5.23% holding-period return for the S&amp;P 500 Composite Index of common stocks in 1987 was the sum of the dividend yield of 3.20% and the capital gain of 2.03%. The -2.69% holding-period return for the index of long-term U.S. government bonds in 1987 was the sum of the coupon yield of 7.96% and a capital gain of -10.65%.1</p> \n  <p>Exhibit 5 provides statistics on the spread between the S&amp;P 500 Composite Returns and the holding-period returns on U.S. government bills, U.S. government bonds, and high-grade, long-term corporate bonds. Cohrs was concerned about the correct time interval to measure these averages, especially given the high returns and volatility of the bond markets shown in Exhibits 4 and 5.</p> \n  <p>&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>&nbsp;</p> \n  <p><img alt=\"Read the case then answer the 2 questions --M\" src=\"https://media.cheggcdn.com/media%2Fe3f%2Fe3ff4530-e87b-44e8-bcac-7a68c1992e2b%2Fimage\" style=\"height:auto;margin:0px;\" /></p> \n  <p>-</p> \n  <p>&nbsp;</p> \n  <p><img alt=\"Read the case then answer the 2 questions --M\" src=\"https://media.cheggcdn.com/media%2F418%2F41867e6c-d70e-44d1-998e-494352efa1dc%2Fimage\" style=\"height:auto;margin:0px;\" /></p> \n  <p>-</p> \n  <p>&nbsp;</p> \n  <p><img alt=\"Read the case then answer the 2 questions --M\" src=\"https://media.cheggcdn.com/media%2Ffa6%2Ffa6192b4-19bd-49ac-8915-9cd2f46015ed%2Fimage\" style=\"height:auto;margin:0px;\" /></p> \n  <p>-</p> \n  <p>&nbsp;</p> \n  <p><img alt=\"Read the case then answer the 2 questions --M\" src=\"https://media.cheggcdn.com/media%2F34e%2F34ed0eb2-241f-4bca-95d8-6d0db19bf7e9%2Fimage\" style=\"height:auto;margin:0px;\" /></p> \n  <p>-</p> \n  <p>&nbsp;</p> \n  <p><img alt=\"Read the case then answer the 2 questions --M\" src=\"https://media.cheggcdn.com/media%2F6d8%2F6d89abc3-a0f0-4e8e-b29c-bbf62283aeb9%2Fimage\" style=\"height:auto;margin:0px;\" /></p> \n  <p>&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>After reading the case answer this questions :</p> \n </body>\n</html>", "transcribedContent": "12A.

C. All 16 cells in a morula are truly totipotent, meaning that they can become any cells in the human body. D. The trophoblast has an important role in maintaining the pregnancy, as it prevents the endometrium from shedding. 6. The chance of successful fertilization is approximately 18% in every cycle. Why does this statistic seem so low? All of the following statements provide a reason as to why the chance of fertilization is only 18% for every ovarian cycle except A. There are two Fallopian tubes and two ovaries, but only one of them releases an ovum every cycle. B. Some sperm cells are not very motile, while others are formed without a tail. C. The lady part is very acidic, killing many sperm cells. D. If more than one sperm fertilize an egg, multiple embryos can result. 7. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) hormone is produced by a fertilized egg in order to maintain elevated levels of estrogen and progesterone. hCG is also used to induce ovulation during IVF procedures and is known to stimulate the production of testosterone in the testes. Which of the following hormones has similar functions as hCG? A. LH B. FSH C. Estrogen D. Inhibin 9. Which mechanism prevents an ovum from being fertilized by multiple sperm cells? A. When more than a single sperm cell fuses with the plasma membrane, multiple zygotes can form, leading to the conception of twins or triplets. B. The egg can only survive in the Fallopian tube for 24 hours as it does not have mitochondria to produce energy. C. Once a sperm penetrates the jelly-like coating of the egg, no other sperm cells can penetrate the coating. D. When a sperm fuses with the plasma membrane of the egg, depolarization of the membrane occurs. 10. Which of the following scenarios does not describe an event that leads to the conception of twins? A. Two eggs are fertilized by two sperm cells, resulting in fraternal twins. B. High levels of FSH stimulates maturation of three ovums. C. One egg is fertilized by one sperm but divides into two zygotes, resulting in two babies of the same gender. D. Two eggs are fertilized by one sperm cell, resulting in monozygotic twins. 32.

The lease arrangement calls for a flat monthly fee up to 18,000 machine-hours. If the machine-hours used exceeds 18,000, then the fee becomes strictly variable with respect to the total number of machine-hours consumed during the month. Lease expense is a major element of overhead cost.  Using the high-low method, estimate a manufacturing overhead cost formula based on the data given above for last year and this year.  Assume that the company consumes 23,100 machine-hours during a month. Using the high-low method, estimate the total overhead cost that would be incurred at this level of activity.

VERILOG design language will be used to implement a 2 to 4 and a 3 to 8 decoder Discussion: Decoder and Demultiplexer - The Decoder performs an opposite function to that of the multiplexer. It connects one input line to one of several output lines. A decoder is another combinational logic device that acts as a \"minterm detector\". A decoder can be made by using a demultiplexer with its input as 'l'. Examine the spec sheet in Appendix A (starting on page 9 of Appendix A) for 74155. For an input word of n-bits, the decoder will have 2\" outputs, one for each minterm 0 to 2. When a bit pattern is placed on the decoder's inputs (which corresponds to a minterm), the corresponding decoder output will be *o' while the non-selected outputs will be 'L'. Since the outputs are inverted (active low), a NAND gate is used to \"OR\" the minterms. The enable inputs allow for connecting two or more 74155's together to decode longer words. Logic functions can be implemented rather easily with a decoder. Rather than wiring logic gates to realize a sumof- products, the desired minterms can be obtained by OR-ing the appropriate outputs from the decoder with a NAND gate if the outputs are active low or an OR gate if the decoder outputs are active high E 3:8 Decoder W F(w.x,y,z) 3:8 Decoder X \u0443 2 Figure 5-1: Cascaded Decoders \r\nPre-Lab Assignments: 1. Read this experiment to become familiar with this experiment. 2. Draft the Design Specification Plan. 3. Draft the Test Plan for the experiment. 4. Represent the two functions in a truth table and in the minterm list form. For the three input functions, obtain a schematic diagram using one 3-to-8 decoder (active high) and an OR gate. For the four input function, two 3-to-8 decoders will be needed. D3_8E AO DO A1 D1 A2 D2 D3 D4 D5 D6 D7 Figure 5-2: 3-to-8 Decoder Component Procedure: 1. Create the VERILOG source file which consists of the code for multiplexer and then Save the project file. One way to implement the decoder is to use if-else statements, which have the following format: \r\nif(expression) begin program code end else if(expression) begin program code end else begin program code end The conditional operators that can be used with an if statement, are the same as c programming language: less than <- less than or equals greater than greater than or equals equal to not equals Vivado will create a template for your code. You need to fill the procedural code that implements a decoder. module mydecoder24vlog (en, in, out); input en; // Enable signal input 11:0in; output 3:0 out; ???? // Declare 'out' as a register always@(????) // Fill the sensitivity list begin if(en=-1) casein) 2\"b00: out - 450001; 2'501: // Fill this line // Fill this line // Fill this line Endcase else if(en--0) begin out-??? // What should \"out\" be? end end endmodule 5-3 \r\nFirst, add a line to declare the output 'out' as a register. We need to do this since we'll assign a value to 'out' in the procedural code (between 'begin' and \"end\" keywords). Remember, the register of 'out' should be the same size as the signal out\" (that is, 4 bits). Then, fill the sensitivity list. You should ask the question: when should this code refresh, that is, run again? Typically, a code should refresh if any one of its inputs changes. The first if-statement checks if the enable signal is 1. If it is, the decoder will see the value of the input to determine which output to assert. Only one output will be \"l' in this case and the other outputs are \"0\". In the first line of the case statement, if the input is 00, the output is 0001. That is, the line out[O] is 'T' and the other output lines are *o'. Fill the remaining lines in the case statement. Finally, if the enable is '0', all the outputs should be *o'. This assignment can be done in one line. Fill it in the code. The figure below shows you the 3-to-8 decoder that we will build in VERILOG. We will use a programming mode in VERILOG called structural'. In the structural mode, we describe the structure of the circuit, which we have in the figure below. By looking at the figure, we can see that we need two 2-to-4 decoders (we'll use the procedural model that we created mydecoder24vlog\") and one inverter. VERILOG has the inverter ready made for us, so we can use it. 2-to-4 Decoder 11 NG 07 06 05 04 \u0399\u039f 0 1 En 0 2-to-4 Decoder 3 2 03 02 01 1 0 En 0 00 12 wirel Figure 5-3: A 3-10-8 Decoder Built with Two 2-to-4 Decoders \r\nNow, let's look at the code template that Xilinx created for us for the 3-to-8 decoder in the file 'mydecoder38vlog'. In the code below, we added a new variable of type 'wire that we called 'wirel'. Why do we need the wire? If we look at the figure above, we can see that every signal is either an input (10, 11, 12) or an output (O0 through 07). However, the line going out of the inverter and into the enable of the lower decoder is neither an input nor an output to the 3-to-8 decoder. It is an internal wire. So we can use the 'wire' type in VERILOG to take care of this connection. module mydecoder38vlog (in, out); input 12:0in; // 3-bit input output 17:01 out; // 8-bit output wire wirel; // Declaring a wire I/module mydecoder24vlog (en, in, out); mydecoder24vlog decoderl (in[2], in[1:0), out|7:41); mydecoder24blog decodero (???, ???, ???); not invertero (wirel, in[2]; endmodule Now, we'll declare two instances of the module 'mydecoder24vlog' to make the 3-to-8 decoder. Since the 2-to-4 decoder module is in the same folder, Xilinx will find it. The first line declares a 2-to-4 decoder and calls is decoderl'. You can call this name anything you want. It's like in C language when we write int x;'. The term 'int' is the variable type and the term 'x' is the variable name that we can call anything we want. Here, the type is 'mydecoder24vlog', the module that we wrote earlier. Also, notice that we put the header of mydecoder24vlog' commented out. We need the header because when we make an instance of the 2-to-4 decoder, we need to provide the input and output in the same order as in that module. Therefore, we should provide the enable signal first, the input (a bus of 2 bits) second and finally, the output, a bus of 4 bits. By looking at the figure, we can see that the enable signal of the upper decoder is '12', therefore, we replace it with in[2]'. We have also filled the input and output signals of the upper decoder. Fill the instance line of the second decoder. For the inverter, we should provide the output first, \"wirel', and then the input second, 'in[2]', as in the figure. 2. Click on Run Synthesis on saving the project. Once it is successfully completed, Click on Run Implementation. 3. Once RTL analysis is performed, another standard layout called the I/O Planning is available. Click on the drop-down button and select the 1/0 Planning layout. Expand the Open Elaborated Design entry under the RTL Analysis tasks of the Flow \r\nNavigator pane and click on Schematic to obtain the design that is created. Obtain a screenshot of the generated diagram to reproduce it in the report. 4. Expand the Open Synthesized Design under Synthesis tab of the Flow Navigator to obtain the Package View of the design generated. Assign the package pins accordingly. The 2-Bit Inputs will be assigned to the switches SWO (V17), SWI (V16), SW2(W17), and SW3(W15) and the output should be linked to LEDO (LDO) on the BASYS3 board. These names can also be found inside the parentheses below the switches and the ones in the right side of the LEDs on the board. The value of 10 Std for all of these switches should be set to \"LVCMOS33\". 5. Once the package pins are assigned, save the constraints file by clicking \"File\" > \"Save Constraints'. Name and save the constraint file. 6. Then we should simulate the design using the XSim Simulator. Click Add Sources under the Project Manager tasks of the Flow Navigator pane. Select the Add or Create Simulation Sources option and click Next. We create a new file for simulation *** Sim.v\". For the simulation file, we don't need to set the 10. Click OK in this step 7. Double click on the *** Sim.v\". in the Sources window to type in the time constraints into the file. Within the UUT, the simulation step size and the resolution can be specified in line 1. The Test-bench module definition begins on line 23. Line 33 instantiates the UUT (unit/module under test). Also, it should be mentioned that the timescale for both the Verilog module and the test-bench module is set to Ins/lps. 8. Click on Run Simulation > Run Behavioral Simulation under the Project Manager tasks of the Flow Navigator window. The test-bench and source files are compiled and the XSim simulator is run (assuming no errors). Click on the \"Zoom Fit\" icon to see all the spectrum of simulation. 9. In the last part, let's click on the Generate Bitstream on the left hand menu towards the bottom. Vivado runs through both Run Synthesis and Run Implementation before it generates the bitstream automatically. This process generates the * BIT file needed to program the FPGA. The following window will be opened if the bitstream is generated. 10. Go to \"Flow \u2192 Hardware Manager\" in the toolbar. Turn ON your board by pushing up its power switch. Click on \"Auto Connect\" icon in the Hardware Manager window. Click on the board name \"xc7a35t_0 (1)\". In the opened \"Hardware Device Properties\" window, make sure the bit file is selected for the \"Programming file\". Next, right click on the board name and choose \"Program Device...\". Once the status \r\nof the board goes to \u201cProgrammed\", then you can check the design functionality on the board by changing the state of switches. 11. Once the simulation is completed, verify if the outputs are in sync with code. 12. Download the design in Step 1 to the BASYS board with AO = SWO(V16), AI SWI(V17), A2 = SW2(W17) and the output = LEDO(LDO) to LED7(LD7) using the package pins. Generate a new truth table to verify that the design works correctly. Questions: (To be incorporated within the Conclusion section of your lab report.) 1. If the decoder has active low outputs (74155) instead of active high outputs as the case for D3_8E 3-to-8 decoder, why can a NAND gate be used to logically OR its outputs? 2. Which MSI function, multiplexer or decoder would best implement multiple output functions (i.e. many functions of the same input variables)? Why? 3. What are the advantages of using an FPGA over MSI devices or SSI devices? 4. In this experiment, the enable line is used to obtain a 4-to-16 decoder. What needs to be added to obtain a 5-to-32 decoder using the D3_8E 3-to-8 decoders? Draw a schematic of a 5-to-32 decoder (using four D3_8E 3 to 8 decoders). 5. Write the Test Plan of how this experiment should be tested. 6. Write the Product Specification Plan to verify that the all the requirements have been meet.

NSB earns an interest rate spread of 3% (the difference between the rate at which it lends money and the rate it pays depositors) by lending money for home-loan purposes at 5%. Thus, NSB would gain $60 on the interest spread if a depositor had an average Premier Account balance of $2,000 in 2017 ($2,000 x 3% = $60). nud The Premier Account allows depositors unlimited use of services such as deposits, withdrawals, checking accounts, and foreign currency drafts.

For each of the events listed here, identify which of the determinants of demand or supply are affected. Also indicate whether supply increases or decreases. Then draw a diagram to show the effect on the price and quantity of Under Armour Clothes. a. The NCAA signs a deal with Under Armour, allowing Under Armour to provide athletic clothing to all universities and colleges, and requiring all students to wear Under Armour athletic gear in sports classes, club teams, and exercise classes. b. A strike by synthetic fiber manufacturing staff raises the price of the synthetic fiber Under Armour uses to make its clothing. C. Engineers develop new machinery that makes it cheaper to produce Under Armour clothing. d. The price of Nike athletic clothing, a substitute, rises. e. A stock market crash lowers people's wealth. 5. The Nation of Retrieverville does not allow imports of clothing. In its equilibrium without trade, a T-shirt costs $18, and the equilibrium quantity is 4 million T-shirts. One day, after speaking to his economic advisors, President Hrabowski decides to open the Retrieverville market to international trade. The market price of a T-shirt falls to the world price of $14 dollars. The number of T-shirts consumed in Retrieverville rises to 6 million T-shirts, while the number of T-shirts produced declines to 2 million. a. Illustrate the situation described in a graph. Your graph should show all the numbers. b. Calculate the change in consumer surplus, producer surplues, and total surplus that results from opening up trade.

The other end of the spring is attached to a wall, and there is negligible friction between the block and the horizontal surface. When the block is pulled to a position beyond the spring's natural length and released from rest, the block experiences simple harmonic motion. A graph of the force exerted on the spring as a function of the block's position is shown What is the spring potential energy stored in the spring-block system at position B? A 0.13 0.43 01.63 \r\nQuestion 18 A student attaches a block to a vertical spring so that the block-spring system will oscillate in simple harmonic motion if the system is released from rest at a vertical position that is not the system's equilibrium position. Which of the following explanations is correct about why the system oscillates in simple harmonic motion about the block-spring system's equilibrium position? The system oscillates in simple harmonic motion because the block's velocity is directly proportional to and opposite in direction to the block's displacement from the system's equilibrium position. The system oscillates in simple harmonic motion because the block's acceleration is directly proportional to and opposite in direction to the block's displacement from the system's equilibrium position. The system oscillates in simple harmonic motion because the block's acceleration is directly proportional to and opposite in direction to the block's velocity. The system oscillates in simple harmonic motion because the net force exerted on the block is directly proportional to and opposite in direction to the block's acceleration.

Problem Description: The Biotech start-up you are working for is developing new drugs quicker than you can say \"Certain Fungal Infections\". You have been loaned to the marketing department to develop an application that can generate candidate names for these new medications. After some initial market research, your business users have come up with the following criteria for a brand name: It must have at least 6 letters but no more than 12. \u2022 The letters at odd positions (1, 3, 5, ...) must be consonants (bcdfghjklmnprstvwxx). The letters at even positions (2,4,6, ...) must be vowels (aeiou). The letters 'Q' and 'Y' did not \"resonate positively with the focus group and should be avoided The first letter should be capitalized, the rest lowercase. 2. Notes: . You must create a method which generates one new drug name, as follows: String generateName(int size) { - your code here . } The size parameter will be used to create a generated name of the given length. . Every time the application is run, it should generate 10 unique new brand names. Therefore, your main() method will call the generatedne() method 10 times, printing the result each time. Your list should be numbered (see example below). Turn in only your source files. Make sure your class is not in a package that is, it is in the default package). When the requirements refer to odd positions (e.g. 1,3,5), this is the position as a business user sees it. We know that the first position is really numbered O. Careful with this distinction.
