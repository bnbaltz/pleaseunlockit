That's why iPods, digital cameras, smartphones, Game Boys, and the Wil have sold millions of units. These devices require lots of power and can drain batteries quickly. Battery manufacturers are constantly searching for ways to build longer-lasting batteries. A particular manufacturer produces AA batteries that are designed to last an average of 17 hours with a standard deviation of 0.8 hours. Quality control inspectors select a random sample of 50 batteries during each hour of production, and they then drain them under conditions that mimic normal use. Here are the lifetimes (in hours) of the batteries from one such sample: 673 1560 1631 17.57 16.14 17.28 1667 17.28 17.27 1750 15.46 16.50 16.19 559 1754 16.46 15.63 1652 1716 1662 16.71 16.69 1798 16 36 17.s0 1661 9915.64 17.20 17.24 16.68 1655 17.48 15.58 1761 15.98 16.99 1693 1601 754 741 16.91 1660 16.78 15.75 17.31 16.50 1672 17.55 16.46 Do these data suggest that the production process is working properly? Is it safe for plant managers to send out all the batteries produced in this hour for sale? In this chapter, you will develop the tools you need to help answer questions like this. \r\nBetterBatterles (1).pdf+ BL\u0130ldingBetter Batteries%20(1).pdf case closed Building Better Batteries Refer to the chapter-opening Case Study on page 421. Assuming the process is working properly, the population distribution of battery lifetimes has mean \u03bc-17 hours and standard deviation \u03c3-0.8, we don't know the shape of the population distribution. 1. Make an appropriate graph to display the sample data. Describe what you see. 2. Assume that the battery production process is working properly. Describe the shape, center, and spread of the sampling distribution of X is for random samples of 50 batteries. Justify your answers For the random sample of 50 batteries, the average lifetime was x-16.7 18 hours. 3. Find the probability of obtaining a random sample of 50 batteries with a mean lifetime of 16.718 hours or less if the production process is working properly. Show your work. Based on your answer, do you believe that the process is working properly? Why or why not? The plant manager also wants to know what proportion p of all the batteries produced that day lasted less than 16.5 hours, which he has declared \"unsuitable.\" From past experience, about 27% of batteries made at the plant are unsuitable. If the manager does not find convincing evidence that the proportion of unsuitable batteries p produced that day is greater than 0.27, the whole batch of batteries will be shipped to customers. 4. Assume that the actual proportion of unsuitable batteries produced that day is p 0.27. Describe the shape, center, and spread of the sampling distribution of i for random samples of 50 batteries.

One such operation is hole counting. Some Background on Hole Counting (from Shapiro and Stockman's 2001 Computer Vision) In the late 1970s an engineer in Milwaukee implemented a machine vision system that successfully counted the number of bolt holes in crossbars made for truck companies. The truck companies demanded that every crossbar be inspected before being shipped to them, because a missing bolt hole on a partly assembled truck was a very costly defect. Either the assembly line would have to be stopped while the needed hole was drilled, or worse, a worker might ignore placing a required bolt in order to keep the production line running. To create a digital image of the truck crossbar, lights were placed beneath the existing transfer line and a digital camera above it. When a crossbar came into the field of view, an image was taken. Dark pixels inside the shadow of the crossbar were represented as 1s indicating steel, and pixels in the bright holes were represented as 0s, indicating that the hole was drilled. The number of holes can be computed as the number of external corners minus the number of internal corners all divided by four. An external corner is just a 2 x 2 set of neighboring pixels containing exactly 3 ones, while an internal corner is a 2 x 2 set of neighboring pixels containing exactly 3 zeros. Hole Counting Practice To visualize a binary (black and white) image, we will assume that 0s are black (the \u201choles\u201d) and 1s are white (the \u201csteel\u201d). Here is a simple 6 x 6 set of pixels forming an image. Fill in the blank cells with \u201ce\u201d or \u201ci\u201d if they are external or internal corners, and calculate the number of holes using the formula. The solution is on the following page. Here are the correctly-filled-in cells: Calculate the number of holes using the formula described in the background:   #holes = (#e - #i) / 4\n  #holes = (9 \u2013 1) / 4\n  #holes = 2\n A Note The hole counting algorithm will not work for all arrangements of binary pixels. Can you think of examples in which the hole counting algorithm would fail? Your program will only be tested on cases where this simple algorithm produces the correct hole count. Your Tasks Complete the Project 6 by writing code for the following functions. Details of type for the functions can be found in functions.h (provided for you, see details below): readImage \u2013 Reads in lines of 0s and 1s and returns a binary multidimensional vector. Inputs: Two integers \u2013 the number of columns and the number of rows, respectively. Output: The image stored in a two-dimensional vector of ints. printImage \u2013 Outputs the binary image of the multidimensional vector returned by readImage. For formatting, see the output files. Input: Two dimensional vector of ints. Output: Nothing (void). Should print to terminal. countHoles \u2013 Returns the number of holes in the multidimensional vector returned by readImage. Inputs: The two dimensional vector of ints (the image). Outputs: The number of holes as an int. Test Cases \u2022 6 test cases Assignment Notes 1. You are given the following files: main.cpp \u2013 This file includes the main function where the test cases will be run. Do not modify this file. functions.h \u2013 This file is the header file for your functions.cpp file. Do not modify this file. input#.txt \u2013 These four text files will be used to run the test cases. d. correct_output_#.txt \u2013 These text files will be used to grade your output based on the corresponding input files. Be sure that your output matches these text files exactly to get credit for the test cases. You will write only functions.cpp and compile that file using functions.h and main.cpp in the same directory (as you have done in the lab). You are only turning in functions.cpp for the project. Comparing outputs: You can use redirected output to compare the output of your program to the correct output. Use redirected output and the \u201cdiff\u201d command in the Unix terminal to accomplish this: Run your executable on the desired input file. Let\u2019s assume you\u2019re testing input1.txt, the first test case. Redirect the output using the following line when in your directory: ./a.out < input1.txt > output1.txt Now your output is in the file output1.txt. Compare output1.txt to correct_output1.txt using the following line: diff output1.txt correct_output1.txt If the two files match, nothing will be output to the terminal. Otherwise, \u201cdiff \u201cwill print the two outputs. main.cpp: #include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\nusing std::cout;using std::cin;using std::endl;\nusing std::vector;\n\n#include

but powerful algorithms we can use to extract properties of those images. One such operation is hole counting.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p><strong>Some Background on Hole Counting&nbsp;</strong></p> \n  <p>(from Shapiro and Stockman's 2001&nbsp;<em>Computer Vision</em>)&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>In the late 1970s an engineer in Milwaukee implemented a machine vision system that successfully counted the number of bolt holes in crossbars made for truck companies. The truck companies demanded that every crossbar be inspected before being shipped to them, because a missing bolt hole on a partly assembled truck was a very costly defect. Either the assembly line would have to be stopped while the needed hole was drilled, or worse, a worker might ignore placing a required bolt in order to keep the production line running. To create a digital image of the truck crossbar, lights were placed beneath the existing transfer line and a digital camera above it. When a crossbar came into the field of view, an image was taken. Dark pixels inside the shadow of the crossbar were represented as 1s indicating steel, and pixels in the bright holes were represented as 0s, indicating that the hole was drilled. The number of holes can be computed as the number of external corners minus the number of internal corners all divided by four.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>An&nbsp;<em>external corner&nbsp;</em>is just a 2 x 2 set of neighboring pixels containing exactly 3 ones, while an&nbsp;<em>internal corner&nbsp;</em>is a 2 x 2 set of neighboring pixels containing exactly 3 zeros.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p><strong>Hole Counting Practice&nbsp;</strong></p> \n  <p>To visualize a binary (black and white) image, we will assume that 0s are black (the \u201choles\u201d) and 1s are white (the \u201csteel\u201d). Here is a simple 6 x 6 set of pixels forming an image.</p> \n  <p><img alt=\"T 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 \" src=\"//d2vlcm61l7u1fs.cloudfront.net/media%2Fa30%2Fa30f31ea-05af-4706-821a-6a8a5cda1dff%2Fphp78GacI.png\" style=\"height:216px;width:200px;\" /></p> \n  <p>Fill in the blank cells with \u201ce\u201d or \u201ci\u201d if they are external or internal corners, and calculate the number of holes using the formula. The solution is on the following page.</p> \n  <p>Here are the correctly-filled-in cells:</p> \n  <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"//d2vlcm61l7u1fs.cloudfront.net/media%2F38c%2F38cbbce5-03bf-42b6-a1e5-db532cee0bfe%2Fphpagh9Q5.png\" style=\"height:150px;width:250px;\" /></p> \n  <p>Calculate the number of holes using the formula described in the background:&nbsp;</p> \n  <pre>\n  #holes = (#e - #i) / 4\n  #holes = (9 \u2013 1) / 4\n  #holes = 2\n</pre> \n  <p><strong>A Note&nbsp;</strong></p> \n  <p>The hole counting algorithm will not work for all arrangements of binary pixels. Can you think of examples in which the hole counting algorithm would fail?&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>Your program will only be tested on cases where this simple algorithm produces the correct hole count.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p><strong>Your Tasks&nbsp;</strong></p> \n  <p>Complete the Project 6 by writing code for the following functions. Details of type for the functions can be found in functions.h (provided for you, see details below):&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>readImage \u2013 Reads in lines of 0s and 1s and returns a binary multidimensional vector.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>Inputs: Two integers \u2013 the number of columns and the number of rows, respectively.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>Output: The image stored in a two-dimensional vector of ints.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>printImage \u2013 Outputs the binary image of the multidimensional vector returned by readImage. For formatting, see the output files.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>Input: Two dimensional vector of ints.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>Output: Nothing (void). Should print to terminal.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>countHoles \u2013 Returns the number of holes in the multidimensional vector returned by&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>readImage.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>Inputs: The two dimensional vector of ints (the image).&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>Outputs: The number of holes as an int.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p><strong>Test Cases&nbsp;</strong></p> \n  <p>\u2022 6 test cases&nbsp;</p> \n  <p><strong>Assignment Notes&nbsp;</strong></p> \n  <p>1. You are given the following files:&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>main.cpp \u2013 This file includes the main function where the test cases will be run.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p><strong>Do not modify&nbsp;</strong>this file.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>functions.h \u2013 This file is the header file for your functions.cpp file.&nbsp;<strong>Do not&nbsp;</strong></p> \n  <p><strong>modify&nbsp;</strong>this file.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>input#.txt \u2013 These four text files will be used to run the test cases.</p> \n  <p>d. correct_output_#.txt \u2013 These text files will be used to grade your output based on the corresponding input files. Be sure that your output matches these text files exactly to get credit for the test cases.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>You will write only functions.cpp and compile that file using functions.h and main.cpp in the same directory (as you have done in the lab). You are only turning in functions.cpp for the project.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>Comparing outputs: You can use redirected output to compare the output of your program to the correct output. Use redirected output and the \u201cdiff\u201d command in the Unix terminal to accomplish this:&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>Run your executable on the desired input file. Let\u2019s assume you\u2019re testing input1.txt, the first test case. Redirect the output using the following line when in your directory: ./a.out &lt; input1.txt &gt; output1.txt&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>Now your output is in the file output1.txt. Compare output1.txt to correct_output1.txt using the following line: diff output1.txt correct_output1.txt&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>If the two files match, nothing will be output to the terminal. Otherwise, \u201cdiff \u201cwill print the two outputs.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>&nbsp;</p> \n  <p><strong>main.cpp:</strong></p> \n  <pre>\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\n#include &lt;vector&gt;\nusing

Her other assets included an interest in a real estate partnership, a residence on Staten Island, and bank accounts. When Madeline's son Peter was going through a divorce, Madeline wanted to prevent his wife from obtaining any of Madeline's assets. She removed Peter from her will, leaving her daughter Lisa as the sole beneficiary. Lisa orally agreed to transfer half of the assets to Peter after the divorce.

BACKGROUND Newton's laws of motion describe the relationship between a massive object and the forces acting upon that object, and the object's motion in response to those forces. More precisely, the first law defines the force qualitatively, the second law offers a quantitative description of the force, and the third asserts that a single isolated force doesn't exist. Though the laws have been stated in slightly different ways over the past three centuries, they can be summarized as follows: Law 1 In an inertial frame of reference, an object moves at a constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force. Law 2 In an inertial frame of reference, the vector net force' Fnet on an object is equal to the mass m of that object multiplied by the acceleration a of the object: Fnet = ma. (1) This definition of the law assumes a constant mass'. Law 3 When one object exerts a force on a second object, the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first body. These laws hold the necessary information to describe the motion of massive objects. Even so, seeing an equation or a few laws on a page does not immediately instill understanding of those things. The net force is equivalent to the sum of the forces \u03a3F.. The more general law for a non-constant mass is dp F. where p = mv is the momentum. But the mass cannot simply be treated as a function of time. For more on variable-mass systems, read the Wikipedia article The idea of simultaneity is an approximation that breaks down at high speeds. Einstein's special theory of relativity describes the breakdown. For this class, however, we will assume there is no breakdown in Newton's third law. \r\nPART 1: Varying Applied Force 1. Navigate to The Physics Classroom's interactive interface. Open the interface such that you see something like Figure 1. You will need to open it up to be full screen. Some of the interactive elements don't always work in windowed mode. Mass (kg) Push It 3.0 Applied Force (8) 10.0 Surface Friction Velocity 0.30 Time Figure 1: The Physics Classroom's force interactive interface. 2. Set the mass to 3.0 kg and the friction coefficient (the third box) to a value of 0.30, as shown in Figure 1. This value indicates that we are including non-zero friction in our analysis. With this fact in mind, draw a free-body diagram of the block: draw and label all the forces acting on the block. Note: Take the applied force to be rightward. \r\n3. The frictional force is defined as Ffric = un, (2) where he is friction coefficient and n is the support (normal) force. Using the free-body diagram you drew above, calculate the normal force n: n = N Then ise n to determine the friction force: Fapp Ffric TTE Ffric N. This value will remain constant for the remainder of Part 1. 4. For the simulation portion of Part 1, you will use different value of applied force Fapp, as indicated in the below table. Trial Fnet 1 10 N 3.0 kg 21 20 N 3.0 kg 3 30 N 3.0 kg 4 40 N 3.0 kg 50 N 3.0 kg 6 60 N 3.0 kg 7 70 N 3.0 kg 8 80 N 3.0 kg 91 90 N 3.0 kg 10 | 100 N || 13.0 kg 5 For each trial: (i) Input the proper value of Fapp, then press rise to run the simulation. (ii) Calculate the acceleration a from the velocity-vs-time plot that is automatically generated. *We will be working in each dimension independently for the rest of this lab, so boldface letters for force will be replaced with italics. 3 \r\n(iii) Be sure every column in the row is filled before moving to the next trial. (iv) Repeat until every trial is complete. 5. Create a plot of the net force versus the acceleration, as shown in Figure 2. Apply a linear fit 100 data - linear fit 80 60 Net Force N 40 20 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Acceleration m/s? Figure 2: Net force versus acceleration. A linear fit has been added to the data trendline to your plot. If you're using Excel or something similar, have the software display the trendline equation. It should display in slope-intercept form: y = mx +b. What is your slope value? slope = 6. The value of the slope should be almost exactly equal to a quantity you were given earlier. What quantity? Show/explain why this makes sense. 4 \r\nPART 2: Questions 1. Consider a 5.0-kg box that is pushed rightward by an applied force of 20 N. The friction coefficient between the box and the floor is j = 0.5. What is the acceleration of the box? Start by drawing a free-body diagram. 2. An explosion occurs that sends a 15-kg crate skidding (without rotation) across the level floor of a factory at an initial speed of 10 m/s. The crate travels 50 meters in 5 seconds before coming to rest. What is the friction coefficient pe between the floor and the crate? (Hint: Use equations (1) and (2), as well as an equation from Chapter 3's lecture slides.) 5 ", "contentHash": null}, "stats": null, "userHostAddress": null, "course": null, "legacyId": 52379576, "id": "d134dff8-0d3b-476d-b85a-847b5d24407b", "expirationDate": "2020-06-19T19:36:00Z", "availableAnswerTemplates": ["HTML_ONLY"], "lastUpdatedBy": null, "comments": [], "postType": null, "author": {"firstName": null, "lastName": null, "displayName": "Anonymous", "nickName": null, "name": "", "id": "105641364", "profileImage": {"postTargets": null, "mediaType": null, "id": null, "uri": null}, "type": "user"}, "questionState": "AnsweredAndUnrated", "editable": false, "resources": null, "tags": null, "lastUpdatedDate": "2020-06-19T17:56:09Z", "createdDate": "2020-06-19T15:36:00Z", "geoLocation": null, "createdBy": null, "rewardInfo": {"offered": 300.0, "rewarded": 0.0, "status": "Debited"}, "answerCreatedDate": "2020-06-19T17:56:08Z", "anonymous": true, "status": "Open", "statistics": {"answerCount": 1, "searchCount": 0, "viewCount": 0, "editCount": 0, "commentCount": 0}}}, "669e98a4-bf37-46e8-a1a8-4b7c632866ff": {"httpCode": 200, "errors": [], "result": {"bookInfo": null, "subject": {"name": null, "id": 204}, "rating": null, "answers": [], "privacy": "Public", "moderationStatus": "None", "source": {"metadata": null, "sourceType": "CheggWebsite", "id": null}, "title": "Question in Advanced Physics", "content": {"previewImages": null, "templateName": "STUDENT_QUESTION", "mediaType": null, "textContent": "A vacuum chamber has the following gases: 20% oxygen, 60% of nitrogen and 10% of argon and 10% of Hydrogen.

You are to do this without writing anything to the HTML file, you can only work in the JavaScript file. I will use Firefox to look at the DOM of your page after your JavaScript is run. What I see should look exactly like the goal file (with the exception of white space and the script line at the bottom). Try to write as few lines as possible. Be clever about how you access DOM elements. Store references to things that will be used more than once. You have access to all the techniques we've learned up until now and you may use them. Loops, conditional statements, and arrays all may come in handy. Note: This assignment has an extra credit component. To earn extra credit points you must first earn a perfect score on the assignment. Requirements You must use all of the various techniques used in the lesson to manipulate the DOM. You will need to set properties of referenced DOM nodes such as textContent, etc. There are many DOM element properties that you are able to set. You are not limited to just the items I showed. You may use other DOM methods that you look up providing you provide a reference in the comments of your code to the URL or resource where you found the method described. At minimum you must include these DOM methods: createElement createTextNode appendChild removeChild insertBefore The first image is the fixer.js and have to work on.

An engineer has used a voltmeter to supply the voltage and measures the current to calculate the above measurement's resistance and relate it to pressure measurement. iii. The voltmeter resolution is 0.1mA. If the pressure changes from 760 torr to 0.1 torr, the temperature changes from 30\u00b0C to 10\u00b0C and, the corresponding resistance change is exponential with the temperature (resistance decrease with the decrease in temperature).

To keep calculations simple we will work with a random sample of 500 respondents from the ANES dataset. The distribution of responses are as follows:  Region: According to the 2010 Census, 18% of US residents live in the Northeast, 22% live in the North Central region, 37% live in the South, and 23% live in the West. Evaluate whether the ANES sample is representative of the population distribution of US residents. Make sure to clearly state the hypotheses, check conditions, calculate the appropriate test statistic and the p-value, and make your conclusion in context of the data. Also comment on what your conclusion says about whether or not this sample can be considered to be representative.  Region and direction:  We would like to evaluate the relationship between region and feeling about the country's direction. What is the response variable and what is the explanatory variable?

Calculating the debt to GDP ratio Suppose the following statistics characterize the financial health of the hypothetical economy Spendia at the end of 2017: . Gross domestic product (GDP) is equal to $200 billion. \u2022 The national debt is equal to $240 billion. \u2022 The government has a budget deficit of $8 billion. \u2022 The debt ceiling in Spendia is set at $259 billion. The following calculations help you see how the ratio of debt to GDP changes from one year to the next. Complete the first row of the following table by computing the ratio of national debt to GDP. Suppose that nominal GDP remains at $200 billion in 2018, and again the government runs a budget deficit of $8 billion. For simplicity, assume the interest rate on the national debt is 0%, and no payments are being made to reduce the debt. Calculate national debt and the debt-to-GDP ratio in 2018. Enter these values in the second row of the following table. GDP (Billions of dollars) Year 2017 National Debt (Billions of dollars) 240 Ratio of National Debt to GDP 1.20 200 2018 200 Now that the government's national debt has been growing for several years, investors have become worried that the government might default on its debt-that is, might refuse to pay back the investors. As a result, the investors are now willing to lend to the government only if they receive an interest rate of 20%. If the government runs a budget deficit of $10 billion in 2019, the national debt will increase by $ billion. True or False: At the end of 2019, the government of Spendia will exceed the legal limit on how much it can borrow.

If you have two tasks x and y, with y being a successor to x, if x is marked as \"undone\" as it needs to be redone, then also y will need to be redone, as it might use the results of x. To implement this, we will perform two modifications. First, we will endow our scheduler with a redo method, which marks a task and all its successors to be redone.

Matt must decide whether to lay off 20% of the company's employees due to declining revenues. Matt wants you to help him make the best decision possible.

In the following table, identify the order in which these steps are usually taken. Order Decision-Making Steps Identify the alternatives. Evaluate the results. Select the best alternative. Evaluate the alternatives. Define the decision situation. Implement the chosen alternative. After you reviewed the six steps with Matt, he asked for an example of how to evaluate alternatives as he decides whether VoxSigns should lay off employees. Which of the following is the correct example to give to Matt? Even though it is a difficult decision, Matt would decide that VoxSigns should lay off employees as the best way to address the company's immediate need for cash. Matt would assess each option in terms of feasibility, satisfactoriness, and consequences; he will want to consider if the company is capable of implementing each option, as well as the resulting financial returns and other consequences (such as lower employee morale for remaining employees). O Matt would make a list of ways the company might address its financial concerns, such as laying off employees, increasing customer prices, moving to a less expensive office space, or a combination of these ideas. O Matt would articulate the specific issue to be decided: whether laying off employees is the best way for VoxSigns to address the financial pressure it faces. Although Matt likes the structure provided by the rational decision-making process, you caution him that it has some shortcomings. Given the assumptions of the rational decision-making model, why is this process difficult to apply completely in many situations? Check all that apply. Managers may lack the resources to explore creative solutions. Managers often make decisions that are not based on facts and logic. Managers do not always evaluate situations logically. Managers usually have time to research new and novel alternatives. \r\nAlthough Matt likes the structure provided by the rational decision-making process, you caution him that it has some shortcomings.

Based on the absorbance spectrum, what is the peak absorbance wavelength for PNP? (0.5pt) 4. Now that you have an estimation of the peak absorbance wavelength for PNP, you want to refine this value (i.e. get a more precise measurement). Briefly (1-2 sentences) describe how you would accomplish this. (0.5pt) 5. Using Excel or Google Sheets, plot the absorbance data presented in the table below (Table 2) as a scatter plot to generate an absorbance vs. concentration standard curve. After plotting the data, add a linear trendline and generate the equation of the line.

During that time, the kid that delivers newspapers continued to deliver them in the usual manner: that is. flung about all around Reeborg's house. Finally one morning Reeborg decided he was well enough to get out of bed and pick up all the newspapers that were on his property. YOUR TASK: Program Reeborg to leave his house and pick up all the newspapers (beepers) that are on the perimeter of his property. Reeborg should then deposit all but one of these beepers in the vestibule of his house and then return to bed with the one beeper. Retaining that beeper in his pocket, he should face west and turn off. SITUATION DETAILS: In the initial situation, Reeborg is in his bed fac- ing some unknown direction. His bed is defined to be the extreme southwest corner of his house, vestibule excluded. The vestibule is a single corner that juts out from his house and has a one corner wide entrance to the house of one end and an exit on the other. The vestibule is walled on the other two sides. Reeborg's house is a rectangle guaranteed to be at least two corners high and wide. Except for the vestibule walls, there are no protusions or obstacles on the perimeter of the rectangle. There are no obstacles within the house. If any beepers are inside the house, they are to be ignored. Reeborg's property line includes only those corners that lie on the perimeter of his house. That is, only those corners that are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to the walls of his house. This includes corners adjacent to the vestibule. More than one paper may have fallen on the same street corner. There will always be at least one paper on the perimeter. Ignore papers that are not on Reeborg's \r\nStreeto \u263a \u263a Avenue \r\nproperty. Reeborg's property will never be restricted in such a way as to make it impossible for Reeborg to make a complete circuit around his property. CRITICAL OBSERVATIONS: This assignment is meant to exercise YOUR ability to design programs; neither offer nor accept any additional help, except on a one-to-one basis with the instructor (or TA). Remember the Academic Honesty pledge you signed earlier in the semester. This, and future assign- ments, are subject to automated plagiarism scanning (typically using Moss) as well as special grader scrutiny and peer review. IMPLEMENTATION NOTES: . There is NO starter file for this assignment. \u2022 Use as your source file name \"clearpapers.py\". \u2022 Only one turn off() may be used and that one must be located in the main routine. Don't forget to include the title line and global comments at the top of your program Use comments in front of your functions to clarify the purpose of the function. \u2022 This is a \"Classic Reeborg\" assignment; use only the Python technology you learned in items #1 through #17 of the \"Reeborg the Robot Programming Summary\" \u2022 Do NOT use any variables. \u2022 Do NOT use any compound predicates, that is no ANDs or ORs. \u2022 Do NOT use any recursive procedure calls, that is, no functions call themselves.

The program will read in the id number and the won-lost record of a baseball team. It will compute various things about the team, and it will print everything out. Then it will repeat the process for a new team, over and over again, until the entire set of data has been taken care of. At the end, it will print the number of teams. Here are the details: 1. The program will read in the id number of a team (see step 5 below). The program will read in the number of wins this team has and the number of losses. For example, the program could read in the following three pieces of data-and it will print everything read in: 1234 5 7 [this says team 1234 has 5 wins, 7 losses] 2. The program will compute (and print) the total number of games played, which is simply the number of wins plus the number of losses. The program will also print the number of games remaining in the season, which is 25 minus the total number of games played. If the total number of games played is exactly 25, the program will print a message saying the season is finished. If the total is less than 25, the program will print how many games are remaining in the season. You can assume that no team has played more than 25 games (see optional 3 below). For example, for the team shown above, the total number of games played is 12, and there are 13 games remaining (25 - 12 = 13). 3. The program will compute the team's winning average, which is a decimal value between 0 and 1. The winning average is defined to be the number of games won divided by the total number of games played. For the team shown above, the winning average is 5 /12 = 0.4167. The program should print this out as shown above, with exactly 4 decimal places. 4. The program will compare the number of games remaining to both the number of games won and the number of games lost, printing two separate messages-one for each comparison. (Each question below must have a single message printed for it.) First, the program will determine whether or not the number of games remaining is greater than or equal to the number won. Print an appropriate message in either case. Then the program will determine whether or not the number of games remaining is greater than the number lost, it will print an appropriate message in either case. \r\nNote that these two questions are questions\u2014if possible, use my phra se two questions are not the same. And note carefully the phrasing of the two possible, use my phrasing. You must test all of the four possible ations of yes/no answers to these questions - see below. Then the program should skip a few lines of output and repeat the entire series of steps for the next team, and so on, until the last team has been processed. You must decide how to recognize that the last team has been processed. 6. At that point, print the total number of teams in the league, then stop. DATA: Read in data for at least 8-10 teams. Make sure that at least three teams have completed their season, and at least five have not. Have at least three teams with more wins than losses, at least two with an even record, and at least three with more losses than wins. Have a team with the number of wins equal to the number remaining, and have a team with the number of losses equal to the number remaining. Have a team with all wins, and have a team with all losses. (You may read data interactively or from a file. If you use an external file, print and hand in a copy of the data.) Make sure that every possible path is covered by a set of data. Here is a complete set of output for a typical team: team 9867 4 wins 12 losses total number of games played is 16 9 games remaining the winning average is 0.2500 number of games remaining is greater than or equal to number won number of games remaining is not greater than number lost OPTIONALS: 1. For each team that has not completed the season, compute the team's record if it wins all of the remaining games (give the won-lost record and the winning average). and the record if it loses all of the remaining games. 2. Keep track of the team with the best winning average that is not exactly 1. Print this out at the end. Do the same just for those teams that have completed their season. 3. If a team has completed more than 25 games, print an error message, ask the user to type in new data (repeat if necessary). Do NOT process the original set of data.

Title Comment Block i. Create your source code file named main.cpp, and at the very top of the source code use three one line comments to document your name, date, and the exercise, using the following format: Name: Stephen May Date: 02/08/2021 Exercise: Labe Solution 2. Write a C++ program that performs as a Tuffy Titan Height Calculator which prompts the user for the name of a person and his/her height in feet and inches, where the name can contain spaces. Your program should allow unlimited number of inputs and should finish the input cycle when the user types xxx when prompted for the name. Your program should store each user input data into a file for later processing, where the name, feet, and inches are each on a separate line. Once the user types xxx, your program should read in the file and print out a report listing the name, feet, inches, centimeters, and meters of each person, where the centimeters and meters are calculated based on the user input. Your program should use the prompt and output formats exactly as provided in the samples output below. Note: Using the pwd command at the terminal command prompt will display the path of the current directory. Note: Opening a write file with no modes specified will clear its contents. Note: Opening a write file in append mode will allow previous data to be retained. 3. Compile the file using the command below. The -std option tells the compiler that it will use C++ version 17 standards and the -o main option tells the compiler to place the executable code into a file called main. clang++ -std=C++17 main.cpp -o main 4. Run the program using the command below and repeat the steps above until you are satisfied your program output meets the above requirements. I strongly suggest that you run your program using each of the sample outputs below and ensure that all blank lines and new lines are exactly as below. Note that there are 2 blank lines between amount inserted and the dispensed or error output. ./main \r\n5.

You will create a method that asks a quiz question and a method that checks the answer, and you will use those methods to ask multiple questions.

These instructions assume that you are using the Eclipse IDE on your own computer or you may use a different Java environment as long as you can provide Java code and screen shots for your assignment submission. First open your previous Programming Assignment in Eclipse, with the file \"Quiz.java\" in the editor pane. \u2022 Add a static method that asks a question until the user provides valid input. \u2022 Call the method \"ask\". It should take a String parameter, and it should return a String. static String ask(String question) { \u2022 Remember where method definitions go: inside the class (in this case, \"Quiz\") but outside all other method definitions (like \"main\"). It can go before or after the \"main\" definition. \u2022 Ask the user the question repeatedly until the user provides a valid answer: \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", or \"E\". \u2022 Ask the question using \"JOptionPane.showInputDialog\". \u2022 Allow the user to provide a lower-case answer, and convert it to upper case. \u2022 If the user provides an invalid answer, use \"JOptionPane.showMessageDialog\" to tell them, \"Invalid answer. Please enter A, B, C, D, or E.\" Then ask the question again. Repeat until the answer is valid. \u2022 Once the user provides a valid answer, return that answer (converted to upper case). \u2022 Notice that the method does not check whether the answer is correct. It just asks the same question until the answer is valid. Try out your new method. \u2022 Delete the existing loop from your main method, but leave the initialization of the question String. \u2022 Call the \"ask\" method with your question String as the argument (actual parameter). \u2022 Note that you do not have to use the String returned by \"ask\". \u2022 Run your program. It should keep asking the question until you provide a valid answer. It does not yet check the answer. \u2022 Try invalid and valid answers. Now add a method that asks questions using \"ask\" and checks answers. \u2022 Call the method \"check\". It should take two String parameters. static void check(String question, String correctAnswer) { \u2022 The method definition can go before, after, or between the definitions for \"ask\" and \"main\", but it must be inside the \"Quiz\" class and outside the other method definitions. \u2022 In the \"check\" method, call \"ask\" to get a valid answer. String answer = ask(question); \u2022 If the answer is correct, use \"JOptionPane.showMessageDialog\" to report, \"Correct!\" \u2022 If the answer is incorrect, use \"JOptionPane.showMessageDialog\" to report, \"Incorrect. The correct answer is .\" This output should include the actual correct answer. Test the \"check\" method. \u2022 Replace the \"ask\" call in the main method with a \"check\" call. You will need to provide both the question String and the answer String as arguments. \u2022 Run your program. It should keep asking the question until you provide a valid answer. Then it should tell you if your answer is correct. \u2022 Try invalid, incorrect, and correct answers. Add more questions. \u2022 In the main method, call \"check\" with at least two more unique quiz questions, each with a different correct answer, for a total of at least three questions. \u2022 You may either declare and initialize new local variables or reassign the existing question variable after each \"check\" call. \u2022 Run your program. Make sure the responses work as expected for all the questions. Finally, add a score for the quiz. \u2022 Add two static member variables, one for the number of questions and one for the number of correct answers. Initialize them to zero for good documentation. static int nQuestions = 0; static int nCorrect = 0; \u2022 Remember where member variables go: inside a class definition but outside all method definitions. You may declare the variables before, after, or between the existing methods. \u2022 In the \"check\" method, increment \"nQuestions\" each time it is called. \u2022 Also in the \"check\" method, increment \"nCorrect\" for each correct answer. \u2022 Display the score at the end of the main method using \"JOptionPane.showMessageDialog\". Use the text, \" correct out of questions\", with the appropriate numbers. \u2022 Run your program. Make sure it displays the right numbers of questions and correct answers.

It should\nkeep asking the question until you provide a valid answer. It does\nnot yet check the answer. \u2022 Try invalid and valid answers. Now add\na method that asks questions using \"ask\" and checks answers. \u2022 Call\nthe method \"check\". It should take two String parameters. static\nvoid check(String question, String correctAnswer) { \u2022 The method\ndefinition can go before, after, or between the definitions for\n\"ask\" and \"main\", but it must be inside the \"Quiz\" class and\noutside the other method definitions. \u2022 In the \"check\" method, call\n\"ask\" to get a valid answer. String answer = ask(question); \u2022 If\nthe answer is correct, use \"JOptionPane.showMessageDialog\" to\nreport, \"Correct!\" \u2022 If the answer is incorrect, use\n\"JOptionPane.showMessageDialog\" to report, \"Incorrect. The correct\nanswer is .\" This output should include the actual correct answer.\nTest the \"check\" method. \u2022 Replace the \"ask\" call in the main\nmethod with a \"check\" call. You will need to provide both the\nquestion String and the answer String as arguments. \u2022 Run your\nprogram. It should keep asking the question until you provide a\nvalid answer. Then it should tell you if your answer is correct. \u2022\nTry invalid, incorrect, and correct answers. Add more questions. \u2022\nIn the main method, call \"check\" with at least two more unique quiz\nquestions, each with a different correct answer, for a total of at\nleast three questions. \u2022 You may either declare and initialize new\nlocal variables or reassign the existing question variable after\neach \"check\" call. \u2022 Run your program. Make sure the responses work\nas expected for all the questions. Finally, add a score for the\nquiz. \u2022 Add two static member variables, one for the number of\nquestions and one for the number of correct answers. Initialize\nthem to zero for good documentation. static int nQuestions = 0;\nstatic int nCorrect = 0; \u2022 Remember where member variables go:\ninside a class definition but outside all method definitions. You\nmay declare the variables before, after, or between the existing\nmethods. \u2022 In the \"check\" method, increment \"nQuestions\" each time\nit is called. \u2022 Also in the \"check\" method, increment \"nCorrect\"\nfor each correct answer. \u2022 Display the score at the end of the main\nmethod using \"JOptionPane.showMessageDialog\". Use the text, \"\ncorrect out of questions\", with the appropriate numbers. \u2022 Run your\nprogram.
