  <p><img alt="Experiment 5 Questions Please answer the following questions as part of your formal report 1. A student accidently used methanol as the reaction solvent for this experiment. Once the bromobenzene and the magnesium were mixed, a vigorous reaction took place and a volatile liquid was isolated as the main product. What is the structure of this product and explain briefly how it is formed? 2. A Grignard reagent was prepared by reacting bromobenzene with magnesium in diethyl ether. Carbon dioxide gas was then bubbled through the solution, resulting in the formation of a solid organic product after acidic workup. What is the structure of this solid product? Draw a mechanism showing how it is formed in this reaction. 3. What was the purpose of adding magnesium sulfate in this reaction? 4. The following reaction takes place between 2 moles of a Grignard reagent and 1 mol of ester. Draw a plausible arrow-pushing mechanism for this reaction (Hint: consult chapter 10 of your textbook) MgBr (ester) ?? 2 CH3 2.
