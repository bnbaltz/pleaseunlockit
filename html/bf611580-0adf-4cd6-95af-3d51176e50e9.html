Medical doctors consult your group to help diagnose particularly difficult cases. In this assignment, you need to provide explanation for several particularly four difficult cases. In the separate doc a cellular ument named Assignment 3 for submission, you are given 4 difficult cases. Each case you have information for patient history, physical examination, and lab results. Based on these information, whats your diagnosis, more specifically, which organelle is malfunctioning? And what are your rationale for this diagnosis? This scenario and the information provided would not give you an answer but would give you a starting point. After carefully reading this scenario and given information about those 4 difficult cases, you should be able to be more easily analyze these patients and be more easily find outside source via Google, Bing or anything that you choose.

                                        <p>Malfunctioning organelle is peroxisomes.</p>
<p>The peroxisomes perform the function of breakdown of fatty
acids, production of bile acids and proteins, biosynthesis of
lipids.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The peroxisomes are found in high abundance in the cells of
liver because the peroxisomes perform breakdown of hydrogen
peroxide and fatty acids.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The affected organelle is peroxisome because of the following
reasons:</p>
<p>the liver is enlarged because of malfunctioning of peroxisomes
which leads to high levels of hydrogen peroxide, fats and amino
acids in cells&nbsp;</p>
<p>Low muscle tone and inability to move</p>
<p>glaucoma</p>
<p>jaundiced skin due to high level of bilirubin caused by lack of
peroxisomes.</p>
