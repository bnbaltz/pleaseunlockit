<p>11. Between 1959 and 1961, thalidomide was prescribed to
expectant mothers<br>
in Canada for morning sickness. Once it was determined that
thalidomide<br>
was linked to miscarriages and birth defects, it was pulled from
Canadian<br>
pharmacies in 1962. It is estimated that over 20 000 individuals
worldwide<br>
were affected by thalidomide. There are approximately 100
thalidomide survivors<br>
in Canada who have been approved to receive compensation from
the<br>
federal government.<br>
Which of the following over the counter and prescription
medications have not<br>
been linked with birth defects or problems with pregnancy? (Some
research may<br>
be required.)<br>
A. Isotretinoin for acne<br>
B. Advil (ibuprofen)<br>
C. Valproic acid for epilepsy<br>
D. Amoxicillin as an antibiotic</p>
<p>18. Which of the following hormones are involved in uterine
contractions</p>
<p>during parturition?<br>
A. Oxytocin and prostaglandins<br>
B. Prolactin and oxytocin<br>
C. Estrogen and progesterone<br>
D. Prostaglandins and prolactin</p>
<p>20. Labour is controlled by the nervous and endocrine systems
through a positive</p>
<p>feedback system.<br>
In which example have we encountered another positive feedback
system in<br>
Biology 30?<br>
A. Progesterone during menstruation<br>
B. Reflex loop in the PNS<br>
C. Estrogen during ovulation<br>
D. FSH levels during sperm production</p>
<p>21. There are two hormones involved in lactation. The hormone
involved in the<br>
production of the milk and the hormone involved in releasing
milk,<br>
respectively, are<br>
A. prolactin and oxytocin<br>
B. oxytocin and prolactin<br>
C. prolactin and progesterone<br>
D. colostrum and oxytocin</p>
<p>24. Identify the manipulated and responding variable(s) in the
study by placing the letter of<br>
the type of variable in the blank.<br>
Variable:<br>

<p>A. Manipulated<br>
B. Responding</p>
<p>25. Which of the following statements does not correctly
describe the similarities</p>
<p>and differences between male and female reproductive
systems?<br>
A. Eggs and sperm can survive for 3 to 5 days in the Fallopian
tubes.<br>
B. Eggs and sperm contain exactly half of the genetic material of a
normal<br>
somatic cell. Many zygotes with an abnormal number of genetic
material<br>
often do not successfully implant.<br>
C. Millions of mature sperm are produced on a daily basis, whereas
single<br>
mature ovum is released every 28 days.<br>
D. Meiosis is completed after fertilization in eggs, whereas a
mature sperm has<br>
completed meiosis prior to fertilization.</p>
<p>27. Which description below explains how the hormones released
in birth control</p>
<p>pills causes natural ovulation to cease?<br>
A. Birth control pills release progesterone. Progesterone feeds
back to the<br>
pituitary gland, thereby inhibiting FSH and LH and in effect,
stopping the<br>
ovarian and menstrual cycle.<br>
B. Birth control pills release estrogen. Estrogen controls the
secondary sex<br>
characteristics of the female body.<br>
C. Birth control pills release progesterone. Progesterone causes an
increase in<br>
FSH, thereby increasing the production of follicles.<br>
D. Birth control pills release estrogen. Estrogen feeds back to the
posterior<br>
pituitary, causing an increase of LH and thereby ceasing the
ovarian cycle.</p>
<p>28. Which of the following statements correctly identifies the
differences between</p>
<p>spermicidal jelly and a condom?<br>
A. Condoms form a barrier to protect against sperm movement as well
as<br>
viruses. Spermicidal jelly breaks down cell membranes of
bacteria.<br>
B. Condoms are semipermeable membranes whereas spermicidal jelly
does not<br>
form any barrier.<br>
C. Condoms prevent the physical transfer of most sexual
secretions.<br>
Spermicidal jelly kills sperm, but allows fluid transfer.<br>
D. Condoms contain an antibacterial coating while spermicidal jelly
only kills<br>
sperm cells.</p>
