For this situation, which of the following statements are true? Select all that apply.<br />Bulb A will be brighter than bulb B.<br />Bulb A will be dimmer than bulb B.<br />Bulbs A and B will be equally bright.<br />Bulb A will be brighter than bulb C.<br />Bulb A will be dimmer than bulb C.<br />Bulbs A and C will be equally bright.<br />Bulb B will be brighter than bulb C.<br />Bulb B will be dimmer than bulb C.<br />Bulbs B and C will be equally bright.<br /><br />(b) With the circuit still turned on, what will happen to the brightness of each bulb when the switch is closed? Select all the correct statements from the list below.<br />The brightness of bulb A will increase.<br />The brightness of bulb A will decrease.<br />The brightness of bulb A will remain the same.<br />The brightness of bulb B will increase.<br />The brightness of bulb B will decrease.<br />The brightness of bulb B will remain the same.<br />The brightness of bulb C will increase.<br />The brightness of bulb C will decrease.<br />The brightness of bulb C will remain the same.<br />
