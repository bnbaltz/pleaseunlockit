                                        <p>The president or congress today have much more power than what
constitution has originally drafted, There were number of
amandments that were made to constition to gain military
superiority,</p>
<p>Generally speaking for any nation there is war time and
peacetime, But for the United States there was no peacetime, Every
decade after decade it went to far away lands to interfere in
foreign governments, Such behavior has resulted in huge losses both
financially and militarily.</p>
<p>Constitution original drafters never asked the country to go for
war on regular basis, Today we are rightly avoiding more conflicts
in middle east,&nbsp;</p>
<p>US has learnt that market forces will decide the future, It is
not war. Today market price of oil is $35 without any military
intervention, American society and general public must understand
this.&nbsp;</p>
