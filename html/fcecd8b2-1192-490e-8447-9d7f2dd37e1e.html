                                        <p>1) Yes , Unilever should divert money from its premium brands to invest in a lower margin segment of the brand as this segment is untapped to a great extent. This presents opportunity to capture a large market. An establish company like Unilever will be able to produce better products than the small players of the low cost segment. In this growing segment , Unilever can gain the first mover advantage.</p> <p>2) The repositioning of the premium brands as low cost brands has the risk of unfavourable results. Creating a new brand while entering a new segment would increase the costs. Hence brand extension would be the best bet.&nbsp; It would be preferable to use a brand extension and support it by extensive promotion.</p> <p>3) Product- The quality should be better then the similarly priced products from the competitors. It&#39;s packaging should be such that it doesn&#39;t feel like a second rate product. It should produce effective results.</p> <p>Price - The price could be a little higher than the existing low cost segment products yet it should be easily affordable and lower than the premium brands.</p> <p>Promotion-&nbsp; Platforms of the mass media should be used for promotion.</p> <p>Distribution- The distribution should be done in the areas where the target customers reside.</p>
