Real estate agents are licensed professionals who arrange real estate transactions, putting buyers and sellers together and acting as their representatives in negotiations. Real estate agents usually are compensated completely by a commission&mdash;a percentage of the property&#39;s purchase price, so their income depends on their ability to get a deal closed.</p> <p>In the given case, we want to deliver our offer to the seller, the real estate agent will deliver our offer to the seller</p> <p><strong>Correct Option b- Your Real Estate Agent</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Q9.&nbsp;</strong>Smart Way to negotiate</p> <ul> 	<li>Making a counter offer by phone or in person and using persuasive power is a good way to negotiate</li> 	<li>We should always keep in mind the maximum we are willing to pay. So that we realise when to walkout of the deal once the hurdle is crossed</li> 	<li>We should understand the seller, what is his hurdle rate what are his expectation and the current situation of the seller. All this may be used to accomodate the seller.</li> </ul> <p>All the above are the smart ways to negotiate. Adding a personal note to the offer, is not gonna help and just going to show how desperate you are for the deal.</p> <p><strong>Hence correct option is d) Add a personal letter to offer</strong></p>
