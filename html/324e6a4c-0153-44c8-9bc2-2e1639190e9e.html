                                        <p>The circuit can only have 64 nodes, 10 transistors, 65 digital primitive devices and 10<br /> transmission lines in total (ideal or non-ideal) and 4 pair wise couple transmission lines. For<br /> additional limits are the sample library includes 39 analog and 134 digital parts. The device<br /> characterization in the pspice model editor is limited to diodes. Stimulus generation in the pspice<br /> stimulus editor is limited to sine waves (analog) and clock (digital). Circuit optimization with the<br /> Pspice optimization is limited to one goal, one parameter and one constraint. You cannot create<br /> CSDF format data files. You can only display simulation data from simulations performed with<br /> the student version of the simulator. For the Schematics, you can place a maximum of 50 parts<br /> on a schematic design and can only draw on size A sheets. For the Capture, the Pspice libraries<br /> are the only ones included. The standard capture libraries are not included. Import facilities,<br /> netlisters and accessories that are not relevant to Pspice are not included. You cannot save a<br /> design that contains more than 60 parts, (you can view or create larger designs, but you can not<br /> save them). You cannot save a library that contains more than 15 parts.<br /> Colorado State University (CSU) also provided a professional version of Pspice for the<br /> senior and graduated Electrical engineering students. And the license are limited, Colorado State<br /> University (CSU) only had 15 licenses for professional Pspice version. Therefore, only 15<br /> peoples can create and run the circuit at the same time and cannot open the Professional version<br /> window longer than 15 minute. The professional version of Pspice is intended for used by<br /> professional, industry or company. The Circuit simulation is not limited to circuits. You can<br /> draw on both size A and B sheets and can save a design that contains more than 60 parts. You<br /> can save a library that contains more than 15 parts.</p>
