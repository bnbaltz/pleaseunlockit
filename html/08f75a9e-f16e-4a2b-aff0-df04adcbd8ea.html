<p>Brazil is the nation that have a large range of black populace.
In Brazil, around half of one hundred and sixty million populace is
from the mixed-race of African origin. In history, Brazilian Blacks
were poorer than Brazilians of European regions, therefore,
organizations were less targeting the market segment of black
Brazilians. However, with the economic progression of Brazil and
its black populace, a number of companies’ has commenced to invest
in the Brazilian marketplace. (Hill, 2011)</p>
<p>Unilever has launched a number of skin care cosmetics and
products for the black people of Brazil. The strategy of company is
to realize the needs and desires of its target markets so that a
product to fulfill their demand can be launched in that market.
However, in Brazil, the company may face the racial dynamic
matters. (Hill, 2011)</p>
<p>&nbsp;Furthermore, this strategy of Unilever is dissimilar from
its strategies in other nations. The global trade strategy of
Unilever is based on USLP (Unilever Sustainable Living Plan), which
targets on commencing the equal products or brands for its entire
target marketplaces so that equal benefits to its entire
stakeholders can be provided. (Bartlett, 2015)</p>
<p>This signifies that the overall business strategy of Unilever is
to integrate all in one. Company chases the strategy of being
global and sustainable. The overall trade strategy of Unilever is
to unite all its efforts toward consumer insight so that equal
brands to the entire consumers can be provided. This strategy of
Unilever targets to make it a global brand. Unilever is putting
efforts to compete with its opponents with the help of its
sustainability strategy. (Bartlett, 2015)</p>
