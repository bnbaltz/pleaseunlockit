<p>Would you please help me with this Marketing case study about
"<strong>Unilever in Brazil</strong>":</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Should Unilever target the low-income segment of
consumers in the Northeast? To answer this question, examine the
short-term financial implications of the decision as well as its
long-term strategic implications.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Evaluate Unilever’s current brand portfolio .Is a
new brand necessary to serve the low-income segment or could
Unilever reposition one of its existing brands or simply launch a
brand extension? If you judge that a new brand is necessary , write
its positioning statement and choose its name among Unilever’s
worldwide brand names.</p>

                                        <p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Should Unilever target the low-income segment of
consumers in the Northeast? To answer this question, examine the
short-term financial implications of the decision as well as its
long-term strategic implications.</p>
<p>Answer :</p>
<p>Yes I am agree with the statement , that Unilever should target
the low income segment of consumers in Northeast. Unilever's mostly
product are &nbsp; required in day to day life.Every one is
associated with these products.This may &nbsp;be Body soap ,
Washing soap or detergent powder , Hair oil or shampoo etc. Now by
focusing on the low income group they can expand their target
market . Here we are considering only those products of Unilever
whose price is mode rest in market.</p>
<p>Short Term Financial Implications :&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Need strong Working capital : See as they are focusing on the
low income grups means they need more working capital .As
&nbsp;more working capital is necessary that means a special
provisions needs to be arrange.</p>
<p>2) More resources required for increased Production :</p>
<p>As production increased means all the resources which are
required for production like Man , Material , Machine all will be
essential.The coordination , planning of these resources in terms
of financial aspects is very important.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) Special Financial planning : A special provision of financial
planning is very necessary because to enter into new targeted
market with full of confidence .So here strong financial base is
necessary</p>
<p>4) Finance for Marketing Promotions .</p>
<p><strong>Long Term&nbsp;Strategic&nbsp;Implications
:&nbsp;</strong>This is also&nbsp;important&nbsp;to make a changes
in long&nbsp;term&nbsp;strategies&nbsp;also.</p>
<p>Following&nbsp;are the points.</p>
<p>1) Creation of New plant for low cost which is focused on low
income group</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;Product&nbsp;development for low income &nbsp;group</p>
<p>3) Marketing&nbsp;strategies&nbsp;for&nbsp;&nbsp;low income
&nbsp;group</p>
<p>4) Products expansions for&nbsp;&nbsp;low income &nbsp;group</p>
<p>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Evaluate Unilever’s current brand portfolio .Is a
new brand necessary to serve the low-income segment or could
Unilever re position one of its existing brands or simply launch a
brand extension? If you judge that a new brand is necessary , write
its positioning statement and choose its name among Unilever’s
worldwide brand names.</p>
<p>Answer :</p>
<p>Following are the types of products made available by Unilever
worldwide.</p>
<p>1) Food &amp; Drink</p>
<p>2) Home Care&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) Personal Care</p>
<p>4) Water Purifier</p>
<p>At present Unilever is having the products of low income group
eg.Wheel in India .Wheel brand is used as a detergent powder as
well as washing soap.So same category of product can be applied to
Brazil. But still if the Unilever Brazil wants to launch a new
product specially for low income &nbsp;group .They can launch the
product .</p>
<p>For this positioning statement will be as follows .</p>
<p>Wheel For Brazil&nbsp;</p>
<p>Features&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Best quality</p>
<p>2) Low price</p>
<p>3) Wide market coverage</p>
<p>4) Best planned for Low income group</p>
