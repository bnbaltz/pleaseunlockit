                                    <p>Case Study: The Cardiovascular Client</p>
<p>John Williams is a 53 year-old restaurant owner of Italian
descent. John is admitted to the Emergency department at 2400 hours
experiencing severe substernal pain radiating to the back, neck,
and down the left arm. He received Morphine Sulfate 4mg IV at 2430,
and 0100. It is now 0200 and John reports his pain level is 5/10
(previously 10+). Admission interview notes his mother died of a
stroke at age 62 and his father died of a heart attack at age 58.
John has a 5 year history of hypertension that has been effectively
treated with Enalapril. He was also recently diagnosed with Type II
diabetes mellitus and both he and his wife have been struggling
with the adjustment. On admission John’s vitals are: BP 158 / 90,
pulse 100, respirations 24, temperature 37.8. His height is 5’8’’
and he weighs 244 lbs. The cardiac monitor shows sinus tachycardia
with occasional PVCs. Cardiac enzymes were drawn and an ECG was
obtained. An automobile accident 8 days ago in which John sustained
a head injury eliminated him as a candidate for thrombolytic
therapy.</p>
<p>Questions:</p>
<p>1. Identify the cardiovascular risk factors that John presents
with.</p>
<p>2. What is the effectiveness of diabetes self-management
education in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus?</p>
<p>3. What is the effectiveness of various antihypertensive
treatments in patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus?</p>
<p>4. What complications must a nurse prepare for when a client
presents with a suspected MI?</p>
<p>5. What nursing interventions should be initiated to control and
prevent pain when a client presents with chest pain?</p>

                                        <p>1) The cardiovascular risk factors present in John include the following,</p> <ul> 	<li>Family history of stroke and myocardial infarction</li> 	<li>Hypertension</li> 	<li>Type II diabetes mellitus</li> 	<li>Overweight&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p>2) Type 2 diabetes mellitus occurs as a result of resistance to insulin hormone. Patient education about consuming foods having low glycemic index will decrease insulin resistance.&nbsp;</p> <p>3) Destruction of salt in diet, avoiding fast and processed foods, avoiding smoking and alcohol, taking adequate rest and avoiding stress will reduce hypertension and diabetes mellitus.&nbsp;</p> <p>4) Complications that can occur with suspected myocardial infarction include sudden cardiac death, ventricular dysfunction, cardiorespiratory failure, and hematemesis.&nbsp;</p> <p>5) Chest pain can be treated with intravenous morphine, antacids and muscle relaxants.&nbsp;</p>
