                                    <p>A sheet of steel 1.5 mm thick has nitrogen atmospheres on both
sides at 1200°C and is permitted to achieve a steady-state
diffusion condition. The diffusion coefficient for nitrogen in
steel at this temperature is 6 ×10-11 m2/s, and the diffusion flux
is found to be 1.2 × 10-7 kg/m2s. Also, it is known that the
concentration of nitrogen in the steel at the high-pressure surface
is 4 kg/m3. How far into the sheet from this high-pressure side
will the concentration be 2.0 kg/m3? Assume a linear concentration
profile. Do not include units [m] in Moodle answer.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
The purification of hydrogen gas by diffusion through a palladium
sheet was discussed in Section 6.3. Compute the number of kilograms
of hydrogen that pass per hour through a 5-mm-thick sheet of
palladium having an area of 0.20 m2 at 500°C. Assume a diffusion
coefficient of 1.0 × 10-8 m2/s, that the respective concentrations
at the high- and low-pressure sides of the plate are 2.4 and 0.6 kg
of hydrogen per cubic meter of palladium, and that steady-state
conditions have been attained. Do not include units [kg] in
Moodle.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Determine the carburizing time necessary to achieve a carbon
concentration of 0.45 wt% at a position 2 mm into an iron–carbon
alloy that initially contains 0.20 wt% C. The surface concentration
is to be maintained at 1.30 wt% C, and the treatment is to be
conducted at 1000°C. Use the diffusion data for ?-Fe in Table 6.2.
Answer is in hours, do not include units in Moodle.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Nitrogen from a gaseous phase is to be diffused into pure iron at
700°C. If the surface concentration is maintained at 0.1 wt% N,
what will be the concentration 1 mm from the surface after 10 h?
The diffusion coefficient for nitrogen in iron at 700°C is 2.5 ×
10-11 m2/s.</p>

Answer:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
The preexponential and activation energy for the diffusion of iron
in cobalt are 1.1 × 10-5 m2/s and 253,300 J/mol, respectively. At
what temperature will the diffusion coefficient have a value of 2.1
× 10-14 m2/s? Put Moodle answer in Kelvins [K]; do not include
units in answer.</p>
