Thus, if MP &lt; AP, the average product must be decreasing</p> <p>Q3) The answer is (d) as if total output is increasing but not as much, there are diminishing returns to labor and the marginal product is thus positive but decreasing</p> <p>Q4) The answer is (d) as total product is increasing as long as MP is increasing and will reach the maximum point when MP = 0 which happens when quantity is Q4</p>
