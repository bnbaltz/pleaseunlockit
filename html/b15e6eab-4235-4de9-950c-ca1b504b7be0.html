                                    <p>5. Which of the following statements does not correctly describe
the events</p>
<p>following fertilization?<br>
A. As hCG takes over maintaining the endometrium immediately
after<br>
implantation, the corpus luteum degenerates into the corpus
albican.<br>
B. Only the inner cell mass cells in a blastocyst are
pluripotent.<br>
C. All 16 cells in a morula are truly totipotent, meaning that they
can become<br>
any cells in the human body.<br>
D. The trophoblast has an important role in maintaining the
pregnancy, as it<br>
prevents the endometrium from shedding.</p>
<p>6. The chance of successful fertilization is approximately 18%
in every cycle. Why<br>
does this statistic seem so low? All of the following statements
provide a reason<br>
as to why the chance of fertilization is only 18% for every ovarian
cycle except<br>
A. There are two Fallopian tubes and two ovaries, but only one of
them releases<br>
an ovum every cycle.<br>
B. Some sperm cells are not very motile, while others are formed
without a tail.<br>
C. The lady part is very acidic, killing many sperm cells.<br>
D. If more than one sperm fertilize an egg, multiple embryos can
result.</p>
<p>7. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) hormone is produced by a
fertilized egg<br>
in order to maintain elevated levels of estrogen and progesterone.
hCG is also<br>
used to induce ovulation during IVF procedures and is known to
stimulate the<br>
production of testosterone in the testes.<br>
Which of the following hormones has similar functions as hCG?<br>
A. LH<br>
B. FSH<br>
C. Estrogen<br>
D. Inhibin<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. Which mechanism prevents an ovum from being fertilized by
multiple</p>
<p>sperm cells?<br>
A. When more than a single sperm cell fuses with the plasma
membrane,<br>
multiple zygotes can form, leading to the conception of twins or
triplets.<br>
B. The egg can only survive in the Fallopian tube for 24 hours as
it does not<br>
have mitochondria to produce energy.<br>
C. Once a sperm penetrates the jelly-like coating of the egg, no
other sperm<br>
cells can penetrate the coating.<br>
D. When a sperm fuses with the plasma membrane of the egg,
depolarization of<br>
the membrane occurs.</p>
<p><strong>10. Which of the following scenarios does not describe
an event that leads to the</strong></p>
<p><strong>conception of twins?<br>
A. Two eggs are fertilized by two sperm cells, resulting in
fraternal twins.<br>
B. High levels of FSH stimulates maturation of three ovums.<br>
C. One egg is fertilized by one sperm but divides into two zygotes,
resulting in<br>
two babies of the same gender.<br>
D. Two eggs are fertilized by one sperm cell, resulting in
monozygotic twins.</strong></p>
<p><strong>32. Which of the following rows correctly describes the
umbilical cord?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Artery&nbsp;<br>
One artery carrying nutrients to<br>
the fetus.</strong></p>
<p><strong>VEIN</strong></p>
<p><strong>Two veins carrying waste to</strong> t<strong>he
mother</strong></p>
<p><strong>B. Artery&nbsp;<br>
Two arteries carrying oxygen to<br>
the fetus</strong></p>
<p><strong>Vein</strong></p>
<p><strong>One vein carrying carbon dioxide to<br>
the mother<br>
C. Artery&nbsp;<br>
Two arteries carrying waste to<br>
the mother.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Vein</strong></p>
<p><strong>One vein carrying nutrients to<br>
the fetus<br>
D. Artery&nbsp;<br>
