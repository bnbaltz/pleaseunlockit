                                        <p>The correct answer is:&nbsp;D and E only</p>
<p>A. A firm's weighted average cost of capital stays constant as
the firm’s debt-equity ratio increases. <strong>This is not
correct. In the presence of taxes, the WACC decreases as D/E
increases, reaches a minimum and then again starts
increasing.</strong></p>
<p>B. The value of an unlevered firm is equal to the value of a
levered firm plus the value of the interest tax shield. <strong>Not
correct, this is other way round.&nbsp;The value of an levered firm
is equal to the value of a unlevered firm plus the value of the
interest tax shield.</strong></p>
<p>C. The capital structure of a firm does not matter for firm
value because investors can create homemade leverage. <strong>This
is correct, in the absence of taxes. In the presence of taxes, this
is not correct.</strong></p>
<p>D. The value of a firm increases as the firm's debt increases
because of the interest tax shield. <strong>This is
correct.</strong></p>
<p>E. Modigliani and Miller’s propositions&nbsp;<em>with
taxes</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>without taxes</em>&nbsp;both imply
that the firm’s cost of equity should be increasing in the
debt-equity ratio. <strong>This is correct.</strong></p>
<p>F. The firm’s weighted average cost of capital is equal to
r<sub>U</sub>×(1-T<sub>c</sub>) where r<sub>U</sub>&nbsp;is the
firm’s unlevered cost of capital and T<sub>c</sub>&nbsp;is the
firm’s corporate tax rate. <strong>This is not correct, The impact
of tax is only on the cost of capital driven by the debt
portion.</strong></p>
