                                        <p>Brazil is home to a sizable racial minority. Brazilians think of
themselves as part of a culture that transcends race. Unilever
initially thought that the African segment transcended national
borders of America &amp; Africa. Unilever marketed its products,
specifically targeted at black people in the same way it was
effective in US. But black Brazilians did not response well to
this. Unilever then understands that because Brazil’s blacks think
of themselves as falling into a range of skin tones rather than
simply black and hence Unilever approach to the Brazilian market
has been to target the entire population rather than certain
segment. New Campaign featured 3 women with different skins.
Product meant for “tan and black skin” which could include many
white women. New strategy correctly defined Brazilians as a part of
a culture that transcends color or race. This strategy shows that
Unilever is using localization approach for its marketing.
Basically unilever strategy for Global market is to select some
features to include in all its campaigns while localizing other
features. Save some costs, customize to different cultures while
still having consistent brand image.</p>
