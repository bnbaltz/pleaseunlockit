have probably spent a fair amount of time learning about Freudian
theory. Even people who are relatively unfamiliar with psychology
as a subject have at least some awareness of&nbsp;psychoanalysis,
the school of thought created by Sigmund Freud. While you may have
some passing knowledge of key concepts in psychoanalysis like the
unconscious, fixations, defense mechanisms and dream symbolism, you
might wonder exactly how these ideas fit in together and what
influence they really have on contemporary psychologists.</p>
<p>In this brief overview of Freudian theory, learn more about some
of the major ideas proposed by Freud.</p>
<p>The Driving Forces</p>
<p>According to Freud psychoanalytic theory, all psychic energy is
generated by the&nbsp;libido. Freud suggested that our mental
states were influenced by two competing forces: cathexis and
anticathexis. Cathexis was described as an investment of mental
energy in a person, an idea or an object. If you are hungry, for
example, you might create a mental image of a delicious meal that
you have been craving. In other cases, the&nbsp;ego&nbsp;might
harness some of the id's energy to seek out activities that are
related to the activity in order to disperse some of the excess
energy from the id. If you can't actually seek out food to appease
your hunger, you might instead browse through a cookbook or browse
through your favorite recipe blog.</p>
<p>Anticathexis involves the ego blocking the socially unacceptable
needs of the id. Repressing urges and desires is one common form of
anticathexis, but it involves a significant investment of energy.
Remember, according to Freud's theory, there is only so much
libidinal energy available. When a lot of this energy is being
devoted to suppressing urges via anticathexis, there is less energy
available for other processes. Learn more about how these competing
forces work and interact in this overview of&nbsp;cathexis and
anticathexis.</p>
<p>Freud also believed that much of human behavior was motivated by
two driving instincts: the life instincts and the death instincts.
The life instincts are those that relate to a basic need for
survival, reproduction and pleasure. They include such things as
the need for food, shelter, love and sex. He also suggested that
all humans have an unconscious wish for death, which he referred to
as the death instincts. Self-destructive behavior, he believed, was
one expression of the death drive. However, he believed that these
death instincts were largely tempered by the life instincts. Learn
more about how these two forces interact and function in this
overview of the&nbsp;life and death instincts.</p>
<p>The Basic Structure of Personality</p>
<p>In Freudian theory, the mind is structured into two main
parts:&nbsp;the conscious and unconscious mind. The conscious mind
includes all the things we are aware of or can easily bring into
awareness. The unconscious mind, on the other hand, includes all of
the things outside of our awareness
