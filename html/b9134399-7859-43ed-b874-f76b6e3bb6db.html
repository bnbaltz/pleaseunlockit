Such a construction is sufficiently useful that it gets its own name;</p> <p>we define the pullback of f by φ, denoted φ∗f, by</p> <p>φ∗f = (f ◦ φ) . (5.1)</p> <p>The name makes sense, since we think of φ∗ as “pulling back” the function f from N to M.</p> <p>We can pull functions back, but we cannot push them forward. If we have a function</p> <p>g : M → R, there is no way we can compose g with φ to create a function on N; the arrows</p> <p>don’t fit together correctly. But recall that a vector can be thought of as a derivative operator</p> <p>that maps smooth functions to real numbers. This allows us to define the pushforward of a vector; if V (p) is a vector at a point p on M, we define the pushforward vector φ∗V at the</p> <p>point φ(p) on N by giving its action on functions on N:</p> <p>(φ∗</p> <p>V )(f) = V (φ∗f) . (5.2)</p> <p>So to push forward a vector field we say “the action of φ∗V on any function is simply the</p> <p>action of V on the pullback of that function.”</p> <p>This is a little abstract, and it would be nice to have a more concrete description. We</p> <p>know that a basis for vectors on M is given by the set of partial derivatives ∂µ = ∂</p> <p>∂xµ , and</p> <p>a basis on N is given by the set of partial derivatives ∂α = ∂</p> <p>∂yα . Therefore we would like</p> <p>to relate the components of V = V µ∂µ to those of (φ∗V )=(φ∗V )α∂α. We can find the</p> <p>sought-after relation by applying the pushed-forward vector to a test function and using the</p> <p>chain rule (2.3):</p> <p>(φ∗</p> <p>V )</p> <p>α∂αf = V µ∂µ(φ∗f)</p> <p>= V µ∂µ(f ◦ φ)</p> <p>= V µ ∂yα /∂xµ ∂αf....... . (5.3)&nbsp;</p> <p>This simple formula makes it irresistible to think of the pushforward operation φ∗ as a matrix</p> <p>operator, (φ∗V )α = (φ∗)α</p> <p>µV µ, with the matrix being given by</p> <p>(φ∗ )α µ = ∂yα/ ∂xµ ...... (5.4)&nbsp;</p> <p>The behavior of a vector under a pushforward thus bears an unmistakable resemblance to the</p> <p>vector transformation law under change of coordinates. In fact it is a generalization, since</p> <p>when M and N are the same manifold the constructions are (as we shall discuss) identical;</p> <p>but don’t be fooled, since in general µ and α have different allowed values, and there is no</p> <p>reason for the matrix ∂yα/∂xµ to be invertible.</p> <p>It is a rewarding exercise to convince yourself that, although you can push vectors forward</p> <p>from M to N (given a map φ : M → N), you cannot in general pull them back — just keep</p> <p>trying to invent an appropriate construction until the futility of the attempt becomes clear.</p> <p>Since one-forms are dual to vectors, you should not be surprised to hear that one-forms can</p> <p>be pulled back (but not in general pushed forward). To do this, remember that one-forms</p> <p>are linear maps from vectors to the real numbers. The pullback φ∗ω of a one-form ω on N</p> <p>can therefore be defined by its action on a vector V on M, by equating it with the action of</p> <p>ω itself on the pushforward of V :</p> <p>(φ∗ω)(V ) = ω(φ∗ V ) .......... (5.5)&nbsp;</p> <p>Once again, there is a simple matrix description of the pullback operator on forms, (φ∗ω)µ =</p> <p>(φ∗)µ</p> <p>αωα, which we can derive using the chain rule. It is given by</p> <p>(φ∗)µ α = ∂yα /∂xµ .......(5.6)</p> <p>That is, it is the same matrix as the pushforward (5.4), but of course a different index is</p> <p>contracted when the matrix acts to pull back one-forms.</p> <p>There is a way of thinking about why pullbacks and pushforwards work on some objects</p> <p>but not others, which may or may not be helpful. If we denote the set of smooth functions</p> <p>on M by F(M), then a vector V (p) at a point p on M (i.e., an element of the tangent space</p> <p>TpM) can be thought of as an operator from F(M) to R. But we already know that the</p> <p>pullback operator on functions maps F(N) to F(M) (just as φ itself maps M to N, but</p> <p>in the opposite direction). Therefore we can define the pushforward φ∗ acting on vectors</p> <p>simply by composing maps, as we first defined the pullback of functions:</p> <p><img alt="R

Since</p> <p>the pushforward φ∗ maps TpM to Tφ(p)N, the pullback φ∗ of a one-form can also be thought</p> <p>of as mere composition of maps:</p> <p><img alt="laps.

But do keep straight what exists and what</p> <p>doesn’t; the actual concepts are simple, it’s just remembering which map goes what way</p> <p>that leads to confusion.</p> <p>You will recall further that a (0, l) tensor — one with l lower indices and no upper ones</p> <p>— is a linear map from the direct product of l vectors to R. We can therefore pull back</p> <p>not only one-forms, but tensors with an arbitrary number of lower indices. The definition is</p> <p>simply the action of the original tensor on the pushed-forward vectors:</p> <p>(φ∗T)(V (1), V (2),...,V (l) ) = T(φ∗ V (1), φ∗ V(2),...,φ∗ V (l) ) , .....(5.7)</p> <p>where Tα1···αl is a (0, l) tensor on N. We can similarly push forward any (k, 0) tensor Sµ1···µk</p> <p>by acting it on pulled-back one-forms:</p> <p>(φ∗ S)(ω(1), ω(2),...,ω(k)&nbsp;</p> <p>) = S(φ∗ω(1), φ∗ω(2),...,φ∗ω(k) ) . (5.8)&nbsp;</p> <p>Fortunately, the matrix representations of the pushforward (5.4) and pullback (5.6) extend to</p> <p>the higher-rank tensors simply by assigning one matrix to each index; thus, for the pullback</p> <p>of a (0, l) tensor, we have</p> <p>(φ∗T)µ1···µl = ∂yα1 /∂xµ1 ··· ∂yαl/ ∂xµl Tα1···αl , ........(5.9)&nbsp;</p> <p>while for the pushforward of a (k, 0) tensor we have</p> <p>(φ∗ S) α1···αk = ∂yα1 /∂xµ1 ··· ∂yαk/ ∂xµk Sµ1···µk .......

One common occurrence of a map between two manifolds is when M is actually a</p> <p>submanifold of N; then there is an obvious map from M to N which just takes an element</p> <p>of M to the “same” element of N. Consider our usual example, the two-sphere embedded in</p> <p>R3, as the locus of points a unit distance from the origin.

(5.11)</p> <p>In the past we have considered the metric ds2 = dx2 + dy2 + dz2 on R3, and said that it</p> <p>induces a metric dθ2 + sin2 θ dφ2 on S2, just by substituting (5.11) into this flat metric on R3. We didn’t really justify such a statement at the time, but now we can do so. (Of course</p> <p>it would be easier if we worked in spherical coordinates on R3, but doing it the hard way is</p> <p>more illustrative.)

Once again, the answer is the same as you would get by naive</p> <p>substitution, but now we know why.</p> <p>We have been careful to emphasize that a map φ : M → N can be used to push certain</p> <p>things forward and pull other things back. The reason why it generally doesn’t work both</p> <p>ways can be traced to the fact that φ might not be invertible. If φ is invertible (and both φ</p> <p>and φ−1 are smooth, which we always implicitly assume), then it defines a diffeomorphism</p> <p>between M and N. In this case M and N are the same abstract manifold. The beauty of</p> <p>diffeomorphisms is that we can use both φ and φ−1 to move tensors from M to N; this will</p> <p>allow us to define the pushforward and pullback of arbitrary tensors. Specifically, for a (k,l)</p> <p>tensor field T µ1···µk ν1···µl on M, we define the pushforward by</p> <p>(φ∗</p> <p>T)(ω(1),...,ω(k)</p> <p>, V (1),...,V (l)</p> <p>) = T(φ∗ω(1),...,φ∗ω(k)</p> <p>, [φ−1</p> <p>]</p> <p>∗</p> <p>V (1),..., [φ−1</p> <p>]</p> <p>∗</p> <p>V (l)</p> <p>) ,</p> <p>(5.14)</p> <p>where the ω(i)</p> <p>’s are one-forms on N and the V (i)</p> <p>’s are vectors on N. In components this</p> <p>becomes</p> <p>(φ∗</p> <p>T)</p> <p>α1···αk</p> <p>β1···βl = ∂yα1</p> <p>∂xµ1 ··· ∂yαk</p> <p>∂xµk</p> <p>∂xν1</p> <p>∂yβ1 ··· ∂xνl</p> <p>∂yβl</p> <p>T µ1···µk</p> <p>ν1···νl . (5.15)</p> <p>The appearance of the inverse matrix ∂xν /∂yβ is legitimate because φ is invertible. Note</p> <p>that we could also define the pullback in the obvious way, but there is no need to write</p> <p>separate equations because the pullback φ∗ is the same as the pushforward via the inverse</p> <p>map, [φ−1]</p> <p>∗.</p> <p>We are now in a position to explain the relationship between diffeomorphisms and coordi-</p> <p>nate transformations. The relationship is that they are two different ways of doing precisely</p> <p>the same thing. If you like, diffeomorphisms are “active coordinate transformations”, while</p> <p>traditional coordinate transformations are “passive.” Consider an n-dimensional manifold</p> <p>M with coordinate functions xµ : M → Rn. To change coordinates we can either simply</p> <p>introduce new functions yµ : M → Rn (“keep the manifold fixed, change the coordinate maps”), or we could just as well introduce a diffeomorphism φ : M → M, after which the</p> <p>coordinates would just be the pullbacks (φ∗x)µ : M → Rn (“move the points on the man-</p> <p>ifold, and then evaluate the coordinates of the new points”). In this sense, (5.15) really is</p> <p>the tensor transformation law, just thought of from a different point of view.</p> <p><img alt="xu

Given a diffeo-</p> <p>morphism φ : M → M and a tensor field T µ1···µk ν1···µl (x), we can form the difference between</p> <p>the value of the tensor at some point p and φ∗[T µ1···µk ν1···µl (φ(p))], its value at φ(p) pulled</p> <p>back to p. This suggests that we could define another kind of derivative operator on tensor</p> <p>fields, one which categorizes the rate of change of the tensor as it changes under the diffeo-</p> <p>morphism. For that, however, a single discrete diffeomorphism is insufficient; we require a</p> <p>one-parameter family of diffeomorphisms, φt. This family can be thought of as a smooth</p> <p>map R × M → M, such that for each t ∈ R φt is a diffeomorphism and φs ◦ φt = φs+t. Note</p> <p>that this last condition implies that φ0 is the identity map.</p> <p>One-parameter families of diffeomorphisms can be thought of as arising from vector fields</p> <p>(and vice-versa). If we consider what happens to the point p under the entire family φt, it is</p> <p>clear that it describes a curve in M; since the same thing will be true of every point on M,</p> <p>these curves fill the manifold (although there can be degeneracies where the diffeomorphisms</p> <p>have fixed points). We can define a vector field V µ(x) to be the set of tangent vectors to</p> <p>each of these curves at every point, evaluated at t = 0. An example on S2 is provided by</p> <p>the diffeomorphism φt(θ, φ)=(θ, φ + t).</p> <p>We can reverse the construction to define a one-parameter family of diffeomorphisms</p> <p>from any vector field. Given a vector field V µ(x), we define the integral curves of the</p> <p>vector field to be those curves xµ(t) which solve</p> <p>dxµ/ dt = V µ . .......(5.16)&nbsp;</p> <p>Note that this familiar-looking equation is now to be interpreted in the opposite sense from</p> <p>our usual way — we are given the vectors, from which we define the curves.&nbsp;</p>
