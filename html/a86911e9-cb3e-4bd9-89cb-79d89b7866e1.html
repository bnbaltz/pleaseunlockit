Business is good, and the current solution is starting to get low on disk space. In addition, the owner has some other needs that might require more disk space, and he wants to keep the data on separate volumes. He wants a flexible solution in which drives and volumes arent restricted in their configuration. He also wants to be able to add storage space to existing volumes easily without having to reconfigure existing drives. He has the budget to add a storage enclosure system that can contain up to 10 HDDs. Which Windows feature can accommodate these needs, and how does it work? ">

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Storage Spaces for creating
flexible storage</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to the need of the given
case, the CSM Tech publishing should have to use and implement the
“Storage Spaces” feature of the Windows. This feature was
introduced in Windows Server 2012 which has the ability to provide
flexible virtual storage space. It is actually a technology in
Windows and Windows Server for providing protection to the stored
data from any kind of drive failures. It follows the concept of the
RAID and uses software for implementation. It is generally used by
grouping three and more drives collectively into a storage pool. It
creates storage space by using the capacity of the storage pool.
The storage space stores extra copies of the stored data so if any
drive fails then we can get data from these extra copies. Also, if
the Windows is “low on capacity” state then we can add more drive
to the storage pool.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>How Storage space
works</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Storage space uses the thin
provisioning for allocating the storage which is completely
different from the traditional physical disk management. The thin
provisioning uses the dynamic expansion of disks through which any
user can provide a large volume even the limited capacity of
physical storage. After this, the user can add the physical disks
and storage space into additional storage according to the need. In
the case where disk pool gets full then Windows generates an alert
for additional physical storage to the disk pool. In this way, by
following the concept of “Just a Bunch of Disk or JBOD”, the
Storage Space works. In JBOD, two or more disks are logically added
together into a single disk to the Operating System. By adding the
physical disk to the storage pool, it is possible to expand the
existing volume into a new required space.</p>
