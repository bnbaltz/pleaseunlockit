<p>2. How does Diamond Blackfan Anemia&nbsp;affect the synthesis of

<p>3. Suppose a mutation was found in a gene that codes for the
structure of RNA polymerase. Recall that RNA polymerase is an
enzyme responsible for copying DNA sequences into RNA sequences.
Predict how this will affect the processes of transcription and
translation. Justify your prediction.</p>

RPS19&#39;s haploinsufficiency contributes to impaired biogenesis of the ribosome and thus protein synthesis.</p> <p>3&nbsp;Proteins can not be manufactured or poorly produced. If mutations occur in gametes, the DNA of the offspring will be positively, negatively, or neutrally affected.Total modification of the amino acid sequence of a protein is the result of a frameshift mutation. This transition occurs during translation since, in terms of codons, or groups of three nucleotides, ribosomes read the mRNA strand. The reading frame is named for these classes.The key transcription enzyme is RNA polymerase. Transcription starts when the RNA polymerase binds near the beginning of a gene to a promoter sequence (directly or through helper proteins). One of the DNA strands (the template strand) is used by RNA polymerase as a template to create a new, complementary RNA molecule.Mutations of RNA polymerase may increase (rpoB268) or decrease (rpoB255), rpoC3, rpoB265) termination at the IS2 terminator by the rho15 factor. Irrespective of the IS2 insertion or the rho15 mutation, the rpoC1 mutation improves the gal operon transcription.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>
