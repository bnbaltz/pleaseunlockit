<ul>
<li>Clara was a 20-year-old college student with an engaging
personality but not many friends. She was referred due to excessive
anxiety and general difficulties in controlling her life.
Everything was a catastrophe for her, though she carried a 3.7 GPA,
she was convinced that she would fail every test she took. As a
result, she repeatedly threatened to drop courses after only
several weeks of classes because she feared that she would not
understand the material. Although she had an occasional panic
attack, this was not a major issue to her. As soon as the panic
subsided, she focused on the next possible catastrophe. Irene was
also concerned about her health, she had high blood pressure,
tension headaches, and a “nervous stomach”, with a lot of gas,
occasional diarrhea, and some abdominal pain.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Hazel had her first attack when she was 25 years old, just a
few weeks after she came home from the hospital after her
appendectomy. The surgery had gone well, and she was not in any
danger, which is why she did not understand what happened. When she
went to sleep, she woke up a few hours later with a vague feeling
of apprehension. She felt her heart ponding, her chest hurt and
felt like she was dying because of a heart attack. During that
time, she ran to her sister’s room but she still felt like she was
a puppet or a robot who was under the control of somebody else
while she was running.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Kylie was 67 years old and lived in a second-floor walkup
apartment in a lower-middle-class section of the city. She shared
that she had not answered the door herself for the past 15 years
because she was afraid to look into the hallway. She could enter
her kitchen and go into the areas containing the stove and the
refrigerator, but for the past 10 years, she had not been to the
part of the room that overlooked the backyard. Thus, her life for
the past decade had been confined to her bedroom, her living room,
and the front half of her kitchen. She relied on her adult daughter
to bring groceries and visit once a week and her only contact with
the outside world was through the television and the radio. As long
as she stayed in her apartment, she was relatively free of
panic.</li>
