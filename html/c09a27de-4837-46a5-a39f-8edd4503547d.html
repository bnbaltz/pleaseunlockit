Symptoms typically appear in middle age, but onset can occur at almost any age, and the course of the disease can range from 15 to 20 years. The molecular basis of HD is becoming better understood, and the genetic mutation has been traced to a gene that encodes a protein (Mr 350,000) of unknown function. In individuals who will not develop HD, a region of the gene that encodes the N-terminus of this protein has a sequence of CAG codons (for glutamine) repeated 6 to 39 times in succession. In individuals with adult-onset HD, this codon is typically repeated 40 to 55 times. In those with childhood-onset HD, the codon is repeated more than 70 times. Thus, the length of this simple trinucleotide repeat indicates whether an individual will develop HD and at approxi- mately what age the first symptoms will occur. A small portion of the N-terminal coding sequence of the 3,143-codon HD gene is given below. The nucleotide sequence of the DNA is shown in black, the amino acid sequence corresponding to the gene is in blue, and the CAG repeat is shaded (the numbers at left indicate the starting nucleotide and amino acid residue numbers in that row. outline a PCR-based test for HD that could be carried out on a blood sample. Assume that each PCR primer must be 25 nucleotides long. By convention, un- less otherwise specified, a DNA sequence encoding a pro- tein is written with the coding strand-the sequence identical to the mRNA transcribed from the gene (except for U in the mRNA in place of T)-on top, such that it is read 5 3, left to right.

makes it simple identify the number of repeats present using a PCR
