                                        <p>Amazon Inc., an American based company incorporated on 28 May
1996 offers a wide range of products and services through its
website and dedicated application. It is an e-commerce organization
which have presence in 16 countries and 4 continents. It operates
trough three segments Amazon Web Service (AWS), International and
North America.</p>
<p>The corporate strategy of Amazon can be described as “concentric
diversification” which means leveraging on technological
capabilities to push market penetration and following cost
leadership strategy for business success. Amazon offers maximum
value to its customers by adopting this strategy where customer can
get qualitative product in competing price hence increasing more
footprint in the market.</p>
<p>Business level strategy of Amazon is that it has broadened the
base products over time. Amazon was initially offering book sharing
services, CDs and DVD sharing service. Gradually it broadened its
product and include consumer product in its kitty. It is the
largest online shopping company in the world. It offered from
fashion to electronics, furniture to books etc. Amazon has
diversified itself into online Video and Audio streaming through
Amazon Prime. It also offered Amazon Web Service (AWS) which is a
cloud-based enterprise solution.</p>
<p>None of the competitors of Amazon has such scale and intensity
in its operation. It has competitors in segments but not on
consolidated level. It enjoys the unique position in the market
that is the reason Amazon is the second most valuable company in
the world after Apple. Competitors of Amazon has individual
business level strategy on their segment like it compete with
Netflix for Amazon Prime. Here strategy of Netflix is to create
content with global presence and it produces the show with local
partners. In Amazon prime video, Amazon only shared the content in
its platform it does not produce it. In the same way different
business level strategy, it has to face with the competitors.</p>
