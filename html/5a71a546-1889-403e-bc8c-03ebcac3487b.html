                                    <p>Dears,</p>
<p>I need a help me with this marketing case study about
"<strong>Unilever in Brazil</strong>":</p>
<p>1. Should Unilever target the low-income segment of consumers in
the Northeast? To answer this question, examine the short-term
financial implications of the decision as well as its long-term
strategic implications.</p>
<p>2. Evaluate Unilever’s current brand portfolio .Is a new brand
necessary to serve the low-income segment or could Unilever
reposition one of its existing brands or simply launch a brand
extension? If you judge that a new brand is necessary , write its
positioning statement and choose its name among Unilever’s
worldwide brand names.</p>
<p>3. Design the marketing mix. Choose the price, promotion
(objectives, message and mix),product(formulation and
packaging),and distribution that will allow Unilever to create and
capture- value for low-income consumers in the Northeast of
Brazil.</p>

                                        <p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 1:</strong>&nbsp;
To determine whether low-income consumers should even be targeted
in the first place a long evaluation needs to occur of the short
and long term goals for Unilever within the region.&nbsp; Holding
an 81% market share shows there is very little room for growth, and
although achieving 100% market share would be ideal, it is very
unrealistic.&nbsp; As such, perhaps maintaining the status quo, and
working to keep competitors at bay is a more effective
strategy.&nbsp; However, the company appears to want to see
immediate growth, thus a change needs to be made.&nbsp; Low-income
consumers do show great potential and the only realistic area to
pursue, thus if growth is sought they should be the market to
interact with. Clothes are washed more frequently than the
southeast region and woman attach the product with social activity
and pride, opportunities that could be exploited.&nbsp; The
planning, research and development will constrain financial
resources in the short term.&nbsp; However, actively working to
service this market shows full long-term strategic commitment to
Brazil.&nbsp; Therefore, the end result will be a stronger Unilever
brand across all incomes and sincere ties to the country, which
will be respected and appreciated by consumers. <strong>Question
2:</strong>&nbsp; A new brand will be necessary to support this
target market.&nbsp; This necessity is driven largely by the
influence of cannibalization.&nbsp; If certain ingredients can be
removed from an existing product to make the new formula cheaper,
the overall profits for Unilever will stay largely unchanged.&nbsp;
Loyal consumers will stay with their higher quality and higher
price brands.&nbsp; More price-concerned consumers will transition
to the new brand, while the switching is offset by the increased
profit margins from the formula change.&nbsp; The break-even for a
new introduction will likely have to occur over the long term, as
the promotion will have to be completed extremely
strategically.&nbsp; Assuring consumers can clearly distinguish
between each brand without negatively affecting the continued
development of the Unilever brand is vital, and marketing
initiatives will be the way Unilever communicates these messages,
thus costs will be higher in the short-run to manage this.&nbsp;
Once consumer expectations and understanding have settled,
marketing costs can reduce and break-even from brand introduction
will be achieved.&nbsp; The new product would be positioned as a
higher quality, low cost detergent aimed at bridging the gap
between Campeiro and Minerva brands.&nbsp; It will satisfy the
quality needs presented by low-income consumers, while staying at a
low cost.&nbsp; Canabalization should be avoided through this
strategically designed decision and result in a growth of overall
market share and profitability.&nbsp; The name to use will be
“Key”, taken from the African region and can be used to cater to
the African roots present in the country.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 3:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><u>Product:</u> As previously
described the newly introduced product will be under the brand name
“Key”.&nbsp; It will be designed with a cheaper formula, while
still being perceived as a quality brand.&nbsp; The largest
difference will be in quality will be the perception created
through marketing initiatives in an effort to minimalize
cannibalization between Campeiro, Minerva and Key,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><u>Price:</u> A described under
distribution, Unilever would begin using a number of smaller,
regional distributors to sell the product, however the price
adjustment due to the ability to leverage the company’s size would
be unaffected.&nbsp; Thus, plans can go forward to position the new
branded product at a favorable pricing index, match with quality,
that will be well received by consumers.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><u>Promotion:</u> The message to
relay is a high-quality product to low-income consumers.&nbsp;
However, brand managers of “Key” and “Minerva” will have to work
together to effectively market the new product so the perception of
Key does not compare, as to avoid cannibalization. The high rates
of individuals who were barely literate affects this piece of the
marketing mix immensely.&nbsp; This inability deters the needs for
coupons, billboards or traditional direct mail advertisings where
literacy skills are necessary for their individual
effectiveness.&nbsp; Instead, the need for popular television media
should be emphasized where imaging and visuals relays the
message.&nbsp; For the same reason, a point-of-purchase promotion
strategy should be emphasized. Following the proven effective
strategy of 70% above the line and 30% below the line communication
expenditure should continue with the new product introduction along
with emphasis on Television and P.O.P. at the forefront of cost
allocation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><u>Distribution:</u> Distribution in
the small outlets is vital to the sale of the new product.&nbsp;
Otherwise, the targeted market will not be effectively reach.&nbsp;
Due to current limitations, Unilever is unable to access all these
small stores, largely due to cost. To limit this, Unilever could
negotiate an exclusivity agreement with a number of smaller
wholesales to reach each region.&nbsp; Costs could be minimized if
the quantity of the business to be conducted is large enough.&nbsp;
This is possible because Unilever has the ability to leverage its
vast size.</p>
