                                    <p>Consider purchasing a system of audio components consisting of a
receiver, a pair of speakers, and a CD player. Let A1 be the event
that the receiver functions properly throughout the warranty
period, A2 be the event that the speakers function properly
throughout the warranty period, and A3 be the event that the CD
player functions properly throughout the warranty period. Suppose
that these events are (mutually) independent with P(A1) 5 .95,
P(A2) 5 .98, and P(A3) 5 .80.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>a. What is the probability that all three components function
properly throughout the warranty period?</p>
<p>b. What is the probability that at least one component needs
service during the warranty period?</p>
<p>c. What is the probability that all three components need
service during the warranty period?</p>
<p>d. What is the probability that only the receiver needs service
during the warranty period?</p>
<p>e. What is the probability that exactly one of the three
components needs service during the warranty period?</p>
<p>f. What is the probability that all three components function
properly throughout the warranty period but that at least one fails
within a month after the warranty expires?</p>

a) Probability= 0.95*0.98*0.80 = 0.7448<br />
b) Probability= 1- no &nbsp;componenet need service =
1-0.95*0.98*0.8= 0.2552<br />
c) All component needs service= 0.0002<br />
d) &nbsp;probability= 0.05*0.98*0.80 = 0.0392<br />
e) probability= Exactly one needs serice =
0.05*0.98*0.80+0.95*0.02*0.8+0.98*0.95*0.2= 0.2402<br />
f) This can not be calculated we need probability after warranty
