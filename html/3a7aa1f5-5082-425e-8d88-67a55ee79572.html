                                    <p>You and your competitor are simultaneously developing a product
and hoping that it will be the industry standard. You can either
cooperate and develop the standard together, or choose to work on
your own product and develop your own standard independently. If
you work together, your company will need to invest $4 Million now
and obtain $1 Million for 6 years beginning from next year. If you
choose to develop your own standard, you will need to invest $10
Million now. The market will accept your standard with 40% chance,
in which case you will obtain $4 Million for 6 years beginning from
next year. With 40% chance, the market will accept your
competitor’s standard, in which case you will obtain $0. Finally,
there is a 20% chance that the market will absorb both standards,
in which case you will make $0.5 Million for 6 years beginning from
next year. MARR is 10%.</p>
<p>a) Draw the decision tree. Make sure to clearly identify
decision, chance, and end nodes. (30 points)</p>
<p>b) Solve the decision tree. Should you cooperate or work on your
own product independently? (20 points)</p>
<p>c) How much would you pay to a market research company that
would reveal, today, before you decide whether to cooperate or not,
whether your product will be accepted, partially accepted or not
accepted (Note that you are required to pay the company before the
information can be revealed)? (20 points)</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>b) In case we cooperate with the competitor to develop the product, the pay off will be calculated as below:</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pay off = -400000 + 1000000(P/A, 10%,6)</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;= -4000000+4355260.70</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;= $ 355260.70</p> 
  <p>In case we do not cooperate, the pay off will be :</p> 
  <p>Pay off = -100,00.000 + 40% {40,00,000(P/A, 10%,6)}+20%{500,000(P/A,10%,6)} + 0 = $-2596056.811</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>Therefore it is better to cooperate as there is a positive pay off.</p> 
  <p>c) Let take ‘x’ as the amount to be paid to the market research company. Then the amount will be calculated as below:</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;= -x + {40%[-10000000+4000000(P/A, 10%,6)]+40%*0+20%*0} &gt; 355260.70</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; -X = 355260.70 - 2968417.119</p> 
  <p>X = &nbsp;$ 2613156.42</p> 
  <p>Therefore this is the amount atht needs to be paid to know whether we should cooperate or not.</p>
