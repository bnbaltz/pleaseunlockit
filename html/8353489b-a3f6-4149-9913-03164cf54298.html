                                        <p>ANSWER:-</p> <p>In the afterword of his new novel, The Illegal, <strong>Lawrence Hill</strong> says it took him five years to write down the book. I read the novel in but each day . And while a reviewer who yearns for respect should never, ever use the phrase &quot;unputdownable,&quot; there we&#39;ve it. The Illegal may be a twisting, intricately woven yarn that spins itself out at a fantastic pace. I couldn&#39;t put the book down. Read it, you must.</p> <p>In The Illegal, Hill takes on the snarled, pressing problems with our moment in time, including race and discrimination, the movement of refugees across borders and therefore the political fight to define who belongs and who is &quot;an illegal.&quot;</p> <p>Keita Ali may be a marathoner, an elite runner from the fictional country of Zantoroland, an isolated island within the middle of the fictional Ortiz Sea &ndash; Hill positions it smack dab within the middle of the Indian Ocean . It&#39;s populated by people whose ancestors, a century and a half ago, were the slaves whose labour built the third wealthiest economy on the earth , the also fictional country of Freedom State, also an island, though much larger than Zantoroland. Got that? If not, I take full responsibility. Hill may be a storyteller of enormous talent, capable of conveying complex information apparently effortlessly. When the book opens, the year is 2018, and Keita Ali is running a punishing race in Freedom State against a vicious opponent who is tormenting him with racial slurs. a bigger story shimmers under the surface: Keita isn&#39;t just running a race, he&#39;s on the run from the police, though the reader doesn&#39;t know why, yet. together with his tormentor at his heels, the unflappable hero calmly ticks his pace up a notch and begins to sing as he surges up the hill: &quot;Want to shatter your opponent&#39;s confidence? Just when he starts to harm , you sing.&quot; The race won&#39;t be put into context until midway through the book, when a mess of characters and narrative threads converge with satisfying resonance.</p> <p>Because the novel&#39;s strength relies on its propulsive plot, and since &quot;spoiler alert&quot; combined with the aforementioned &quot;unputdownable&quot; could end my reviewing career, suffice it to mention that Keita was born in Zantoroland, the son of a renowned journalist whose integrity has cost the family an excellent deal. As a toddler , Keita loved watching elite marathoners train and dreamed of becoming one. Hill&#39;s descriptions of running are richly observed: &quot;The runners spilled along the road like blood out of veins, passing over yet one more hill. Brown arms swung in loose unison and legs churned smoothly, feet nearly soundless on the primary road, aside from the crunching of pebbles.&quot; Zantoroland may be a nation of runners. Perhaps this is often a metaphor, too.</p> <p>Boatloads of refugees are trying the damaging crossing of the Ortiz Sea between Zantoroland and Freedom State. Their hoped-for destination is that the shantytown of AfricTown where both legal and illegal residents sleep in shipping containers rented to them by Lulu, the de facto ruler of AfricTown. the thought of social and racial mobility is vital to the success of the larger project of Freedom State, but actually only a token few escape AfricTown, where, amidst the squalor, an illegal economy thrives. Lulu may be a nebulous moral figure, both benevolent and ruthless: her relationships are transparently transactional. She uses every advantage at her disposal. But who doesn&#39;t? what&#39;s the difference between an honest person and a nasty person? Lulu straddles a line in between. There are bad people during this book: parasitic schemers, power-seekers, a dictator, torturers, purveyors of violence and fear. a number of these people are those who craft partisan, discriminatory laws. and a few who break these laws are good people, journalists who subvert the principles so as to show the reality , an elderly woman who gives library cards to &quot;illegals,&quot; and Keita himself, hiding during a foreign state.</p> <p>Hill draws important distinctions between Zantoroland and Freedom State. Freedom State, as a nation, is an unsatisfactory and incompletely realized compromise, but there&#39;s nevertheless hope in its democratic institutions; Zantoroland, a dictatorship, may be a nightmare, where state-sanctioned torture and killings eliminate dissent. Wealth separates these nations, too. Freedom State&#39;s thriving economy is interdependent on the liberty of movement, freedom of the press, an independent police and therefore the rule of law. Yet its rise to prosperity is thanks to unacknowledged history, its economy built on the enslaved labour of these whose descendants are now excluded or marginalized &ndash; and blamed for his or her own exclusion.</p> <p>The wealthy believe themselves deserving of their wealth, regardless of its origins. They absolve themselves of the wreckage caused by their rise.</p> <p>In this way, The Illegal jogs my memory of Hill&#39;s previous novel, The Book of Negroes: both use story to offer flesh, breath, and blood to cold, calculating political and economic practices. the results of entitled self-interest are measured in Hill&#39;s novels in human terms, and therefore the loss and pain will make a reader weep.</p> <p>In 1997, <strong>Beverly&nbsp;Tatum</strong>, one among the country&rsquo;s foremost authorities on the psychology of racism, answered a recurring question that surfaced in her work with teachers, administrators, and parent groups: Why are all the black kids sitting together within the cafeteria? The result was a critically acclaimed book of an equivalent name that gave readers&mdash;numbering within the many thousands&mdash;a start line to demystify conversations about race, better understand the concept of racial identity, and communicate across racial and ethnic divides.</p> <p>Now 20 years later, the black kids are still sitting together. And Tatum has returned with a revised and updated 20th-anniversary edition of her national bestseller that publishes today. One aspect that has changed dramatically since the first release of Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together within the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race are America&rsquo;s demographics. Latinos and Asian Americans are the most important and fastest-growing populations of color, respectively, with children of color for the primary time outnumbering white children publicly schools. Additionally, the backlash against the election of the primary black president, the continuing segregation of faculties , and highly visible incidents of police violence seem to belie the claim of a &quot;post-racial society&rdquo;&mdash;making Tatum&rsquo;s perspectives on effective dialogue about race and racism especially relevant.</p> <p>Tatum recently shared some thoughts with The Atlantic on why conversations about race remain vexing and what can happen when educators and fogeys avoid those conversations. The interview that follows has been edited for length and clarity.</p>
