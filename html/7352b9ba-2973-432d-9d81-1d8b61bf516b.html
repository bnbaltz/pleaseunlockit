This movement of free electrons in a semiconductive material is called electron current.</p> </div></div><div class="col"><div class="answer"> <p>Electrons remaining in the valence band are still attached to their atoms and are not free to move randomly in the crystal structure. However, a valence electron can move into a nearby hole, with little change in its energy level, thus leaving another hole where it came from. The hole has effectively, although not physically, moved from one place to another in the crystal structure. This current is called hole current.</p> <p>The valence band and the conduction band in a conductor overlap so that there are always many conduction electrons, even without application of external energy where as the energy gap for an insulator is so wide that hardly any electrons acquire enough energy to jump into the conduction band.</p> <p>Thus the energy is more easily established in a semiconductor than in an insulator.</p></div></div></div>
