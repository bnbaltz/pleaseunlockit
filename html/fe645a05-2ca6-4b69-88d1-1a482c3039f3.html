<p>Business Ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Staring a farmer’s market from where other produce like
vegetables, fruits, fish, milk and milk products might be sold. It
can also be used to sell furniture built at the farm.</li>
<li>Advertise the farm as a destination for parties and weddings.
The new barn is a very good space for parties. As there are
metropolitan areas nearby, customers might like the peace and
serenity of the surroundings to have their weddings or other
events.</li>
<li>Bed and Breakfast. The farm can be advertised as a bed and
breakfast for the city dwellers nearby. Customers can spend the
weekend at the farm, partake in farm activities and enjoy the
healthy food. It can be promoted as a green vacation as the farm
uses green energy.</li>
<li>Set up a small technical institute. Use the skills of Earl and
Teev to train local youth. This will help in creating a steady flow
of income, build a stronger bond with the local community and
generate captive talent who can support Earl and Teev in operating
the farm.</li>
<li>Building a distillery on the farm. Some portion of the land can
be devoted to growing barley which can then be used for the
production of beer. This is a little capital intensive but will
bring in a number of visitors and a scenic tavern could be opened
on the farm.</li>
