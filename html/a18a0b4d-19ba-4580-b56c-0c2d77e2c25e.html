  <p><img alt="A toy cart is released from the top of a frictionless inclined track, as shown in the diagram below. Lab Jack Track Stopper a) The track is about 1 m long. The cart takes about a second to reach the end of the track. What is the average speed of the cart just right before it hits the stopper? b) Is the carts velocity (increasing/decreasing) heading down along the track? c) The cart travels down the track with constant (velocity/ acceleration/both). d) What would happen after the cart hits the stopper? It would bounce back up to the releasing position and repeat the motion. It would bounce back up some distance on the track and slide down again. Stop at collision. e) Describe the carts motion when the tracks height is increased.

                                        <p>(a) Average speed of the cart = Distance travelled / Time taken
= 1 / 1 = 1.0 m/s</p>
<p>(b) Cart's velocity is INCREASING heading down along the track,
because the cart is moving with constant acceleration.</p>
<p>(c) The cart travels down the track with constant
ACCELERATION.</p>
<p>In fact the acceleration of the cart is 'a' = g*sin theta</p>
<p>where theta is the elevation angle of the inclined plane.</p>
<p>(d) First option is the correct answer, because the surface is
frictionless and no enery loss occurs.</p>
<p>(e) When the track's height is increased, the average velocity
of the cart is increased. This means, the cart will take less than
one second to complete its journey along the inclined track.</p>
