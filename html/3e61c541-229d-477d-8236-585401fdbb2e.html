  <p>Flood map from lab 4.</p> 
  <p>We can use this data to make a flood map of New York City. When Hurricane Sandy hit New York City in 2012, sea level rose 6 feet above normal, causing extensive flooding in low lying areas (NYT map). For our flood map, we can incorporate the storm surge into our coloring scheme:</p> 
  <pre>
        if elevation &lt;= 0:
            #Below sea level
            Color the pixel blue
        elif elevation &lt;= 6:
            #Below the storm surge of Hurricane Sandy (flooding likely)
            Color the pixel red
        else:
            #Above the 6 foot storm surge and didn't flood
            Color the pixel green
</pre> 
  <p>To give us complete control of the coloring, we will create a new array that will hold the colors for each pixel. Here's an outline of our program:</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li>Import the libraries to manipulate and display arrays.</li> 
   <li>Read in the NYC data and store in the variable,&nbsp;elevations</li> 
   <li>Create a new array,&nbsp;floodMap, to hold our colors for the map.</li> 
   <li>For each element in&nbsp;elevations, make a pixel colored by the schema above.</li> 
   <li>Load our image into&nbsp;pyplot.</li> 
   <li>Display the image.</li> 
  </ol> 
  <p>We'll use a very simple (but a bit garish) color scheme, with our "blue" being 0% red, 0% green, and 100% blue. And similarly, the "red" and the "green" we'll use will be 100% of each, 0% of the others, giving a map like:</p> 
  <p><img src="https://stjohn.github.io/teaching/csci127/f17/floodMap.png" alt="100
300
400
100
200
300
400
"></p> 
  <p>Here's the code, implementing our outline below. Copy it into an IDLE window and run it. It expects that the file&nbsp;elevationsNYC.txt&nbsp;is in the same directory as your program.</p> 
  <pre>
# Name:  ... your name here ...
# Date:  September 2017
# Takes elevation data of NYC and displays using the default color map


#Import the libraries for arrays and displaying images:
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


#Read in the data to an array, called elevations:
elevations = np.loadtxt('elevationsNYC.txt')

#Take the shape (dimensions) of the elevations
#  and add another dimension to hold the 3 color channels:
mapShape = elevations.shape + (3,)

#Create a blank image that's all zeros:
floodMap = np.zeros(mapShape)

for row in range(mapShape[0]):
    for col in range(mapShape[1]):
        if elevations[row,col] &lt;= 0:
            #Below sea level
           floodMap[row,col,2] = 1.0     #Set the blue channel to 100%
        elif elevations[row,col] &lt;= 6:
            #Below the storm surge of Hurricane Sandy (flooding likely)
           floodMap[row,col,0] = 1.0     #Set the red channel to 100%
        else:
            #Above the 6 foot storm surge and didn't flood
            floodMap[row,col,1] = 1.0   #Set the green channel to 100%

#Load the flood map image into matplotlib.pyplot:
plt.imshow(floodMap)

#Display the plot:
plt.show()

#Save the image:
plt.imsave('floodMap.png', floodMap)

</pre> 
  <p>What would you change to make a more fine-grained map? Namely, modify your program to color the region just above the Sandy storm surge (6 feet) and less than or equal to 20 feet the color grey (50% red, 50% green, 50% blue). Also, modify your program to not show any graphics windows (plt.show()) but instead just compute and save the map to&nbsp;floodMap.png. See&nbsp;Programming Problem List.</p> 
  <p>Hello, I need help with this programming assignment below.</p> 
  <p>Modify the flood map of NYC from Lab 4 to color the region of the map with elevation greater than 6 feet and less than or equal 20 feet above sea level the color grey (50% red, 50% green, and 50% blue).</p> 
  <p>Your resulting map should look like:</p> 
  <p><img alt="100
200
300
400
100
200
300
400
" src="https://stjohn.github.io/teaching/csci127/f17/floodMap2.png"></p> 
  <p>and be saved to a file called floodMap.png.</p> 
  <p>Note: before submitting your program for grading, remove the commands that show the image (i.e. the ones that pop up the graphics window with the image). The program is graded on a server on the cloud and does not have a graphics window, so, the plt.show() and plt.show() commands will give an error. Instead, the files your program produces are compared pixel-by-pixel to the answer to check for correctness</p>
