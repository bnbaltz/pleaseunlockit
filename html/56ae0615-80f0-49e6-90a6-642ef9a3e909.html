                                        <p>Amazon is a world-famous online shopping brand. Globalization
leads to a better scope for Amazon and improves efficiency,
coordination, and performance. With the help of TOWS analysis,
Amazon summarizes its threats, opportunities, weaknesses, and
strengths, based on globalization aspects.&nbsp;<br />
Threats: because of globalization, Amazon is continuously facing a
competitive market worldwide. Also, the company is entirely
dependent on venders. It indicates the company is still not aware
of supplier opportunities due to globalization. Patent violation
disputes are the most significant threats for Amazon nowadays as
the public become aware of patents through improved digitization
techniques. There is constant pressure on Amazon to sell
environmentally friendly products in the market.<br />
Opportunities: globalization increases e-commerce opportunities as
people are more comfortable to buy products from their homes.
Growth in internet usage in China, India, and the US can increase
the sales of the company. Growth in digital media and social media
can be used as a selling platform by the company.<br />
Weaknesses: instead of an increasing number of internet usage in
China, Amazon performs very low in this country. In this era of the
globalization era, weak cash flow must be considered as a risk
factor for Amazon. Amazon does not sell products in the low-profit
margin like Wal-Mart. This is why Amazon cannot stand first in the
global market instead of having the widest variety of
products.&nbsp;<br />
Strengths: Amazon is known for its strong brand value worldwide.
Versatility, influential research, and development division and
strong technological application are the key factors for the
success of this company. Amazon holds the most skilled workforce.
It values customers' demands and choices.</p>
