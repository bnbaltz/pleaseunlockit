                                    <br>
                                </h4>

                                        <p>1 Ans:</p>
<p>- Programmed Decision: It is quite simple because $50,000/- is a
huge&nbsp;amount&nbsp;to remodel your&nbsp;kitchen&nbsp;and there
are many contractors who can help you on this. Now a days there are
contractors who can happily work on budgets and if you hire any one
of them, remodeling your kitchen will be a huge success.</p>
<p>- Non-Programmed Decision: As it&nbsp;is named&nbsp;as
a&nbsp;loki(which is basically after the norse of god of mischief)
it follows a protocol. It is on a higher management strategy so
it&nbsp;is considered&nbsp;as a non programmed decisions.</p>
<p>- Non-Programmed Decision: Generally in organisations if any
lease&nbsp;is completed, by considering the higher authority we
need to take an action. We cannot just randomly take any actions as
it is&nbsp;illegal.</p>
<p>- Programmed Decisions: You know well about yourself than others
so it is obvious that you will plan things&nbsp;so&nbsp;by
considering all aspects. As always you will go with your old order
because you are not a person who likes to try something new.</p>
<p>* Your company's events committee learned that there is a 20%
chance of rain on the day of the company picnic. That also means an
80% chance of dry weather, renting an indoor facility
would&nbsp;require&nbsp;a non refundable payment of $1000/-. The
events committee is operating under a
non-programmed&nbsp;decision&nbsp;as it decides whether to keep the
outside&nbsp;location&nbsp;or to move the event indoors.</p>
<p>2 Ans:&nbsp;<br />
- Identify the alternatives.<br />
- Select the best alternative.<br />
- Evaluate the alternatives.<br />
- Evaluate the results.<br />
- Define the decision situation.<br />
- Implement the chosen alternative.</p>
<p>* Matt would make a list of ways the company might address its
financial concerns, such as laying off employees, increasing
customer prices, Moving to a less expensive office space, or a
combination of these ideas.<br />
