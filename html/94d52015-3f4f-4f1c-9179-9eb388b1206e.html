<p><strong>i should fire my advisor immediately as fixing the
currency will lead to severe financial crises as fixing the
exchange rate is difficult in the long run as it is difficult to
maintain the high value of local currency in the long run as it
will become overvalued.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; since
it will be overvalued sooner or later the currency will have to be
devalued and due which investors investing in your market will try
to make the money out of the system which will ultimately lead
towards devaluing your own currency by 30% to 50% depending upon
the damage.</strong></p>
