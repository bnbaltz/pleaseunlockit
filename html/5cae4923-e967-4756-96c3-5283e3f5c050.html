supply, short-run aggregate supply, and aggregate demand curves,
and show each of the following.</p>
<p>(i) Current price level, labeled&nbsp;&nbsp;PL1</p>
<p>(ii) Current real output, labeled&nbsp;&nbsp;Y1</p>
<p>(b) Assume that household income increases as a result of recent
economic prosperity in Country X. On your graph in part (a), show
the effect of the increase in household income on real output and
price level.</p>
<p>(c) What will be the effect of the change identified in part (b)
on unemployment in Country X?</p>
<p>(d) Will the change in real output shown in part (b) be smaller
or larger in the presence of automatic stabilizers? Explain.</p>

The economy will at equilibrium where AD meets AS.</p> <p>Hence the economy is in equilibrium at A</p> <p>a)</p> <p>LRAS is the long-run AS. It is vertical because of the classical assumption that in the long-run there will be always full employment level of output. Hence Y1&nbsp;is the full employment level of output.</p> <p>SRAS is upward sloping due to the assumption of sticky wages.=&gt; infinite supply of labour =&gt; unemployment will be there.</p> <p>Hence at A assume this is long-run equilibrium &amp; hence LRAS also passes through A.Thus&nbsp;the equilibrium price is P1&nbsp;which also equals the Pe&nbsp;and equilibrium output is Y1.</p> <p>b)</p> <p>now the money income increases of the consumer. =&gt; disposable income increases because of consumption = income - taxes. As a result, AD&nbsp;will shift rightward as at every price now the demand has been increased.&nbsp;Now the economy will move to point B in the short run. hence the real output will increases to Y2&nbsp;as well as price level has been increased to P2.</p> <p>c)</p> <p>since, it is assumed that in the short run there is infinite supply of labour &amp; as real GDP has been increased, employment will also be increased. Hence, unemployment reduces in the short-run.</p> <p>But in the long as expected price is now lesser than the P2, hence there will be revision of the expectation. And as&nbsp; a result, AS will now shift upward till expected price and actual price becomes equal. hence in the long run economy will move to C and real GDP return to Y1&nbsp;at full employment level &amp; unemployment will be at again natural level.</p> <p>Only price level will rise in the loong-run i.e. P3.</p> <p>d)</p> <p>automatic stabilizers means something which reduces the impact of fiscal policy on the real output. hence the name stabilizers. e.g. tax</p> <p>In absence of tax we know that multiplier is given by 1/(1 - c), where c is MPC</p> <p>in presence of tax, multiplier = 1/[1 - c(1 - t)], this is less than the above multiplier</p> <p>hence in the presence of automatic stabilizers, change in the real output will be smaller.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>
