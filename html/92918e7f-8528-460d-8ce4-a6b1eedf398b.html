                                        <p>To understand the effect of transactions on current ratio and acid test ratio (i.e. quick ratio), it is neccessary to know that what these ratios are:</p> <ul> 	<li><strong>Current Ratio</strong> = current assets / current liabilities</li> 	<li><strong>Acid test Ratio</strong> = Quick assets / current liabilities</li> 	<li><strong>Quick Assets</strong> = Current assets - inventory</li> </ul> <p>Now,</p> <p><strong>1. Provide services to customer on account:</strong></p> <p>This transaction means that services are being provided on credit.</p> <p>The entry for this transaction would be trade receivable account (sundry debtor) debit and services revenue account will be credited with the same amount.</p> <p>Where, trade receivable account is included in current assets, quick assets and services revenue account is a revenue account.</p> <p>Since, trade receivables are debited, it will increase the amount of trade receivables and also will increase the total amount of current assets, quick assets&nbsp;and change in revenue is not to be taken in our ratios.</p> <p>According to mathematics rule, if in a ratio, numerator increases and denominator remains the same the ratio will increase.</p> <p>Hence, with the increase in current assets, quick assets and no change in current liabilities, <strong>the current ratio and acid test ratio&nbsp;will increase.</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>2. Borrow cash from the bank by signing a long-term note payable.</strong></p> <p>The entry for this transaction would be cash account debit and long term loan account credit with the same amount.</p> <p>Cash is included in current asset,&nbsp;quick assets and long term loan is long term borrowings.</p> <p>Now, our current assets as well as quick assets&nbsp;will increase and there will be no effect on current liabilities.</p> <p>According to mathematics rule, if in a ratio, numerator increases and denominator remains the same the ratio will increase.</p> <p>Hence, with the increase in current assets, quick assets and no change in current liabilities, <strong>the current ratio and acid test ratio&nbsp;will increase.</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>3. Purchase office supplies with cash:</strong></p> <p>The entry for this transaction would be office supplies account debit and cash account credit with the same amount.</p> <p>Where office supplies are included in current assets, quick assets and cash is also included in current assets, quick assets.</p> <p>Since, office supplies and cash are both part of current assets, quick assets; and will be debited and credited with same amount which will not change the total of current assets and quick assets.</p> <p>Hence, <strong>there will be no change in current ratio as well as acid test ratio&nbsp;ratio</strong>.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>4. Pay rent for the current period:</strong></p> <p>The entry for this transaction would be rent account debit and cash/bank account credit with the same amount.</p> <p>Where, rent account is an expense account and cash/bank account is included in current assets, quick assets.</p> <p>Since, cash/bank account is credited it will reduce the casdh/bank balance with which the total of current assets,quick assets will be reduced.</p> <p>According to mathematics rule, if in a ratio, numerator decreases and denomenator remains unchanged, the resulting ratio would be less than the original.</p> <p>Hence, with the decrease in current assets, quick assets;<strong> the current ratio and acid test ratio will decrease.</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Crux:</strong></p> <ol> 	<li>current ratio and acid test ratio will increase.</li> 	<li>current ratio and acid test ratio will increase.</li> 	<li>current ratio and acid test ratio will remain the same.</li> 	<li>current ratio and acid test ratio will decrease.</li> </ol> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>
