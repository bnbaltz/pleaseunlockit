                                        <p><strong>1.</strong></p> <p><strong>A. Copernican Revolution</strong></p> <p style="text-align:justify">In the 16<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century, Nicolaus Copernicus ,a polish mathematician and astronomer, challenge the Geocentric model of Claudius Ptolemy which stated that the planets as well as the sun and the moon, moved in a circular motion around the earth. Ptolemy&#39;s geocentric model was widely accepted by the people and was one of the greatest discoveries of that time. Copernicus introduced a new concept known as Heliocentrism, which suggested that the center of the solar system was not the earth but actually the sun. The idea was rejected at first by the public. It was eventually accepted by the people in a period which was called the birth of modern astronomy.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style="text-align:justify"><strong>B. Darwinian Revolution</strong></p> <p style="text-align:justify">The Darwinian revolution was considered to be one of the most controversial intellectual revolutions of its time.On the origin of species, Darwin introduce the theory of evolution, which postulated that populations pass through a process of natural selection in which only the fittest would survive. He stated that organisms have the ability to adapt to their environment and would gradually change into something that would be more competitive to survive, a process known as evolution.</p> <p style="text-align:justify"><strong>C. Freudian Revolution</strong></p> <p style="text-align:justify">Psychoanalysis is the study that explains human behavior. In his theory, Sigmund Freud explained that there are many conscious and unconscious factors that can influence behavior and emotions.He also argued that personality is a product of three conflicting elements; id,ego and superego.</p> <p><strong>D. Information Revolution</strong></p> <p>We live in the information age. It defines the current economic,social and technological trends beyond the industrial revolution.It is the rapid increase&nbsp;of the availability of information and the accompanying changes in its storage and dissemination owing to the use of computers.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <table style="width:500px"> 	<tbody> 		<tr> 			<td style="text-align:center"><strong>Copernican</strong></td> 			<td style="text-align:center;width:202px"><strong>Darwinian</strong></td> 			<td style="text-align:center;width:167px"><strong>Freudian</strong></td> 			<td style="text-align:center;width:48px"><strong>Information</strong></td> 		</tr> 		<tr> 			<td> 			<ul> 				<li>Introduced by Nicolaus Copernicus</li> 				<li>Heliocentrism, which suggested that the center of the solar system was not the earth but actually the sun.</li> 			</ul> 			</td> 			<td style="width:202px"> 			<ul> 				<li>Introduced by Charles Darwin</li> 				<li>Darwin introduce the theory of evolution, which postulated that populations pass through a process of natural selection in which only the fittest would survive.</li> 			</ul> 			</td> 			<td style="width:167px"> 			<ul> 				<li>Introduced by Sigmund Freud</li> 				<li>personality is a product of three conflicting elements; id,ego and superego.</li> 			</ul> 			</td> 			<td style="width:48px"> 			<ul> 				<li>Current age</li> 				<li>Massive use of computers and technology</li> 			</ul> 			</td> 		</tr> 	</tbody> </table> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>3. How science changed in this revolution?</strong></p> <p style="text-align:justify">Copernican Revolution changed the misconcept of the society about the solar system and the universe. By introducing&nbsp;Heliocentrism, which plays as the stepping stone for many astrological discoveries later.</p> <p style="text-align:justify">Darwinian theory helps the scientific reserchers to evaluate&nbsp;how humanity had evolved.</p> <p style="text-align:justify">Freudian revolution by Sigmund&nbsp;Freud&nbsp;was the first psychoanalyst and the&nbsp;pioneer in the recognition of the&nbsp;importance&nbsp;of unconscious mental activity.</p> <p style="text-align:justify">Information revolution plays a major role in science and technology by inventing, utilizing and developing the available information with the adequate use of technology in all aspects of human life.</p> <p><strong>4. How scientific revolution affects social and cultural progress?</strong></p> <p>The world saw an explosion of new ideas in the 17th centuary. Europian thinkers challenged the conventional thoughts based on traditional authority. A new way of examination changed the way the people looked at their world. The scientific revolution ,largic and reasonable, replaced faith and age old believes.Such a rational and methodological approach that we used today is known as the scientific method has evolved.New ideas, new kbowledge, hypothesis and experimentation has evolved.The priciples of gravity developed new system of maths called calculus developed.</p>
