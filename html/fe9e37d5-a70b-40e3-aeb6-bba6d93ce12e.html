The model uses an infinitesimally small section of a transmission line with four elements as shown below. Here the series resistance, series inductance, shunt conductance and shunt capacitance are all normalized per unit length (denoted by the "prime" notation).</span></span></p> <p style="text-align:start"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222"></span></span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">The propagation constant equation does not easily separate into real and imaginary parts for α and β in the case where R' and G' are non-zero terms. But significant approximations can be made for "low-loss" transmission lines. For these approximations to hold, these conditions must be met:</span></span></p> <p><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222"></span></span></p> <p style="text-align:start"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">What does low-loss mean here? Let's assume that the ratios in the above relations are held to 10%. We made a calculation for PTFE coax, 50 ohms, at 10 GHz. At the conditions described, R'=1500 ohms/meter, and G'=0.6 Siemens/meter. Both would result in losses of 130 dB/meter (or 0.13 dB/mm). This is a very lossy cable by lab standards. Although this is slightly oranges/apples comparison the condition is even lossier than what you might measure on a MMIC transmission line at X-band. Note that the condition scales with frequency, W-band signals can have ten times as much loss and still meet the condition. So the approximation holds for just about any transmission line.</span></span></p> <p><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">Velocity of light can be derived from the inductance and capacitance per unit length of a transmission line.

Also note that it only becomes complex if either R' or G' are non-zero, which will give you a headache if you think about it too long. In practice we try to achieve nearly lossless transmission lines. For a low-loss transmission line, the following relationships will occur:</span></span></p> <p><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222"></span></span></p> <p><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">Then for all practical purposes we can ignore the contributions of R' and G' from the equation and end up with a nice scalar quantity for characteristic impedance. For lossless (or near loss-less) transmission lines the characteristic impedance equation reduces to:</span></span></p> <p><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222"></span></span></p> <p><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">Where, L' is the tendency of a transmission line to oppose a change in current, while C' is the tendency of a transmission line to oppose a change in voltage. Characteristic impedance is a measure of the balance between the two</span></span></p> <p><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">There are many situations where we need to know inductance per unit length and capacitance per unit length of a transmission line. Both can be calculated from the characteristic impedance and the propagation velocity of the wave in a transmission line. The key to solving these equations is that the propagation velocity of a transmission line is a very simple function of its capacitance and inductance per unit length:</span></span></p> <p><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222"></span></span></p> <p><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">Note than when we plug in inductance in H/m and capacitance in Farads/meter, you are talking about one speedy wave, limited to be less than or equal to the velocity of light which is about 3x10E8 meters/second.
