<p style="margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;">2-Based on the
information in the table and your calculations for Question #1:</p>
<p style="margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;">Do any countries have
positive net exports? __________________ Which one(s)?
_____________________________________________________</p>
<p style="margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;">Which country has the
largest negative net exports?
____________________________________</p>
<p style="margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;">Suppose that one of
the countries in the table above asks for your advice about trade.
Policymakers in the country want information about the impact of
trade on GDP and whether they should be concerned about negative
(or positive) net exports. How would you respond?</p>
<p style="margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;">3-<em>Economic
growth:</em> Based on information from the World Bank, in 2018, GDP
per capita was $62,641.0 in the United States and $77,449.7 in
Ireland – very similar values (and relatively high values compared
to many countries). But, the annual rate of GDP growth averages
2.2% in the United States and 5.6% in Ireland.</p>
<p style="margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;">4- Would you predict
the United States or Ireland to have a more rapid increase in the
standard of living in the long run? _________________</p>
<p style="margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;">5-The United Nations
Human Development Index (HDI) uses information about a country’s
life expectancy at birth (health), expected years of schooling and
mean years of schooling (education), and Gross National Income per
capita (standard of living) to create a measure that ranges from 1
(very high) to 0 (very low). For 2017, the United States had a
value of 0.924, compared to 0.926 for Canada and 0.922 for the
United Kingdom – very similar values.</p>
<p style="margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;">Based on this
information, suppose a developing country (such as Afghanistan and
Haiti which each had a value of 0.498) asks for your advice on
which country it should try to emulate in order to increase its
level of development and economic growth. Which country would you
choose? Explain what additional information about each country
would be important to making this assessment.3-</p>
