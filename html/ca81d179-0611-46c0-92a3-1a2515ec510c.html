                                    <p>A professional chef has had many different amounts of items
offered on her menus throughout the years. She was interested in
seeing if the amount of items on the menu was correlated with the
amount of revenue she earned. She recorded the amount of items on
the menu and the revenue she earned for 14 randomly chosen months.
While she was analyzing the data she decided to make a Box Cox
transformation of the data and she derived a lambda equal to
0.0015.</p>
<p>What transformation does this value of lambda suggest?</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;With a lambda close to 0, it does not look like we need
to re-express this data.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;With a lambda close to 0, it looks like we should take
the log of y.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;With a lambda close to 0, it looks like we should take
the square root of y.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;With a lambda close to 0, it looks like we should take
the log of x</p>
