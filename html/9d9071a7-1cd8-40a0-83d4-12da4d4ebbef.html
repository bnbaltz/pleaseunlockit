                                    <p>Chris recently received an array&nbsp;𝑝p&nbsp;as his birthday
gift from Joseph, whose elements are either 0 or 1. He wants to use
it to generate an infinite long superarray. Here is his strategy:
each time, he inverts his array by bits, changing all 0 to 1 and
all 1 to 0 to get another array, then concatenate the original
array and the inverted array together. For example, if the original
array is&nbsp;[0,1,1,0][0,1,1,0], then the inverted array will
be&nbsp;[1,0,0,1][1,0,0,1]&nbsp;and the new array will
be&nbsp;[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1][0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1]. He wonders what the
array will look like after he repeat this many many times.</p>
<p>He ask you to help him sort this out. Given the original
array&nbsp;𝑝p&nbsp;of length&nbsp;𝑛n&nbsp;and two
indices&nbsp;𝑎,𝑏a,b&nbsp;(𝑛≪𝑎≪𝑏,≪(n≪a≪b,≪&nbsp;means much less
than) Design an algorithm to calculate the sum of elements
between&nbsp;𝑎a&nbsp;and&nbsp;𝑏b&nbsp;of the generated infinite
array&nbsp;𝑝̂&nbsp;p^, specifically,&nbsp;∑𝑎≤𝑖≤𝑏𝑝𝑖^∑a≤i≤bpi^. He
also wants you to do it real fast, so make sure your algorithm runs
less than&nbsp;𝑂(𝑏)O(b)&nbsp;time. Explain your algorithm and
analyze its complexity.</p>

                                        <p>Let denote Input Array as P and reverse of this as R. Now, lets examine the pattern for different values of number of times the operations are performed.</p> <p>N=1 - P. N=2- PR. N=3- PRRP. N=4 - PRRPRPPR. N=5 - PRRPRPPRRPPRPRRP.</p> <p>From the pattern, we can see that every block of 4 elements(P&nbsp;or R) has 2 Ps and 2Rs.</p> <p>Now We know the number of 0s and 1s in in given array. So to caluclate the sum of digits between a and b, we will devide the subarray from intex a to index b in sections as describe below :</p> <p>Block B1 = Starts from a. Ends at first ocuurence after a where (index%(4*n)=0). Let this index be j.</p> <p>Block B2= Starts from j, Ends at first ocuurence before b, where (index%(4*n)=0), Let this index be k.</p> <p>Block B3=&nbsp;Starts from k. Ends at b.</p> <p>We will iterate for blocks B1 and B3 to find number of 1s. Complexity will be O(n)</p> <p>For block B2, number of 1s=(k-j)*n*(Number of 1s in original number i.e P). Complexity will be O(1).</p> <p>Now Sum of elements from a to b= Sum of 1s in B1,B2 and B3, which we already have calculated.</p> <p>Overall complexity =O(n)+O(1)=O(n)&lt;&lt; O(b)</p>
