                                    <p>Susan Stoker is a star performer in the ABC Corporation. She
currently holds a position in Pay Grade 4 and is paid near the top
of the range. Susan is being promoted to the next position in her
career path, which is Pay Grade 5. ABC Corporation, as a rule,
provides a $10,000 raise for promotion from Pay Grade 4 to Pay
Grade 5, and Susan is aware of this practice and anticipating this
raise. To further internal equity, ABC Corporation chooses to place
all promoted individuals in a new pay grade at the bottom of the
range. Because of Susanâ€™s current pay at the top of pay grade 4 if
she is given the pay raise of $10,000 she will be well above the
mid-point of pay grade 5. What is your recommendation on how to
deal with this situation and promote both the internal equity of
ABC Corporation and reward Susan for her promotion from Grade 4 to
Grade 5?</p>

This will ensure that Susan is rewarded for her efforts and promotion and also internal equity of ABC Corporation will be maintained by maintaining parity aa a result of placing Susan at the bottom of Grade 5.</p>
