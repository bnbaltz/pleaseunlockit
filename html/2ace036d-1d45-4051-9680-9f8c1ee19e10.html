                                    <p>Draw an entity-relationship diagram that describes the following
business environment. Super League Baseball wants to maintain
information about its teams, their coaches, players, and bats. The
information about players is historic. For each team, the league
wants to keep track of all of the players who have ever played on
the team, including the current players. For each player, it wants
to know about the player’s name, age, and every team the player
ever played for. Currently and historically, each team has and has
had many players. To be of interest to the league, a player must
have played on at least one and possibly many teams during his
career. The league wants to keep track of each team’s team number,
which is unique, its name, the city in which it is based, and the
name of its manager. Coaches have a name (which is only assumed to
be unique within its team) and a telephone number. Coaches have
units of work experience, which are described by the type of
experience and the number of years of that type of experience. A
coach works for only one team. A team has at least one and usually
several coaches. Bats are described by their serial numbers (which
are only unique within a team) and their manufacturer’s name. Each
team owns at least one and generally many bats.</p>
