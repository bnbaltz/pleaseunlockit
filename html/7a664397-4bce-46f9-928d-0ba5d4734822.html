                                        <p>The black population in Brazil is targetted by Unilever just the
same way it had targetted the Black populations in the USA which
was effective previously. However, the marketing&nbsp;strategy
backfired because Unilever did not take into account that the
blacks in Brazil were socio-culturally different from the Blacks in
America. After acknowledging the condition, Unilever then changed
its strategy. Later on, the Unilever chalked out a strategy that
targetted the black populations in Brazil collectively instead of
targetting specific segments of the black population.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unilever used an approach of marketing called localized
marketing. Unilever's advertisement was entirely a different
concept which depicted&nbsp;black skin and white skin as different
tones. This shows that Unilever's overall global marketing strategy
was based on increased market competition and this has resulted in
a globalized marketing strategy.&nbsp;</p>
