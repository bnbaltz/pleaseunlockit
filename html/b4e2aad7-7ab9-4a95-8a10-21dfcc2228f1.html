The producer has full control over price and wages in this market, which leads to downward-sloping marginal revenue and average revenue curve.</p> </div></div><div class="col"><div class="answer"> <p>A monopoly is a market situation that arises when the producer has full control over the resources or technology for producing the product. The producer can charge any price from the customers and also control the wages paid to the laborers in the market. The monopoly tries to increase its profits by increasing prices, reducing wages and reducing the cost of production by economies of scale.</p> </div></div><div class="col"><div class="answer"> <p>The firms who want to enter in the monopoly market are required to pay the tariff set by the producer. Generally, the tariff set by the producer is high, so that the other firms do not enter. But if the firm is ready to pay the tariff, the firm will have to follow the conditions set by the monopoly. This leads to the formation of groups known as trusts.</p> </div></div><div class="col"><div class="answer"> <p>If the market was perfectly competitive, there would have been freedom of entry and exit in the market, and there would not have been any guidelines set by the producer. Since there will be no tariff policy, there will be no formation of trusts. Hence, a monopoly market leads to the formation of trusts.</p> </div></div><div class="col"><div class="answer"> <p>If the tariff rates are lowered, and the trade barriers are reduced, the other firms will have more freedom to enter the market, and the surplus earned by the monopoly reduces as it now has to face competition with other firms. The marginal revenue curve of the monopoly market becomes more elastic, and the monopoly reduces its power.</p></div></div></div>
