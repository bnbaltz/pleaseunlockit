It takes the teller an average of 4 minutes to serve a bank customer. Customers arrive at the drive-up window at a rate of 12 per hour. The bank operation officer is currently analyzing the possibility of adding a second drive-up window, at an annual cost of $20,000. It is assumed that arriving cars would be equally divided between both windows. The operation officer estimate that each minutes reduction in customer waiting time would increase the banks revenue by $2,000. Should the second drive-up be installed? 7 3.The River Clinic has two general practitioners who see patients daily. An average of six patients arrive at the clinic per hour. Each doctor spends an average of 15 minutes with a patient. The patients wait in a waiting area until one of the doctors is able to see them. However, because patients typically do not feel well when they come to the clinic, the doctors do not believe it is good idea to have a patient wait longer than an average of 15 minutes. Should this clinic add a third doctor, and, if so, will this alleviate the waiting problem? ">
