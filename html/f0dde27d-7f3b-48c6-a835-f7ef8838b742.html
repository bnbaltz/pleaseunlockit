<p>While unrealistic, we will examine the forces on a leg when one
falls from a height by approximating the leg as a uniform cylinder
of bone with a diameter of&nbsp;2.3&nbsp;cm&nbsp;and ignoring any
shear forces. Human bone can be compressed with
approximately&nbsp;1.7&nbsp;×&nbsp;108&nbsp;N/m2&nbsp;before
breaking. A man with a mass of&nbsp;80&nbsp;kgfalls from a height
of&nbsp;6&nbsp;m.&nbsp;Assume his acceleration once he hits the
ground is constant. For these calculations,&nbsp;g&nbsp;=
10&nbsp;m/s2.</p>

<p>Which of the following is the reason that we would recommend
that the man bend his legs while landing from such a fall?</p>
<p>Which of the following is the reason that we would recommend
that the man bend his legs while landing from such a fall?</p>
<p>Bending his legs decreases the speed at which he hits the
ground, thus decreasing the force applied by the ground.<br />
Bending his legs increases the time over which the ground applies
force, thus decreasing the force applied by the ground.<br />
Bending his legs allows him to push back up on the ground and
negate some of the effects of the force applied by the
ground.<br />
Bending his legs decreases his overall change in momentum, thus
decreasing the force applied by the ground.</p>
