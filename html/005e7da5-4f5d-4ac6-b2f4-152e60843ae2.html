Accounts receivable are amounts that customers owe the company for
normal credit purchases. Since accounts receivable are generally
collected within two months of the sale, they are considered a
current asset. Accounts receivable usually appear on balance sheets
below short-term investments and above inventory.</td>

<tr>
<td style="height:43.2pt;vertical-align:bottom;width:1067pt;">Notes
receivable are amounts owed to the company by customers or others
who have signed formal promissory notes in acknowledgment of their
debts. Promissory notes strengthen a company’s legal claim against
those who fail to pay as promised. The maturity date of a note
determines whether it is placed with current assets or long-term
assets on the balance sheet. Notes that are due in one year or less
are considered current assets, while notes that are due in more
than one year are considered long-term assets.</td>

<td style="height:43.2pt;vertical-align:bottom;width:1067pt;">
Accounts receivable and notes receivable that result from company
sales are called trade receivables, but there are other types of
receivables as well. For example, interest revenue from notes or
other interest-bearing assets is accrued at the end of each
accounting period and placed in an account named interest
receivable. Wage advances, formal loans to employees, or loans to
other companies create other types of receivables. If significant,
these nontrade receivables are usually listed in separate
categories on the balance sheet because each type of nontrade
receivable has distinct risk factors and liquidity
characteristics.</td>

the time of the credit sales, businesses record accounts receivable
as a debit and sales as a credit in the amount of the sales
revenue. Instead of receiving cash from the sales, companies agree
to delayed payments by holding customers' accounts receivable.</td>

<strong>How are notes receivable accounted for?</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="height:28.8pt;vertical-align:bottom;width:1067pt;">A
note receivable is a written promise to receive a specific amount
of cash from another party on one or more future dates. This is
treated as an asset by the holder of the note. Overdue accounts
receivable are sometimes converted into notes receivable, thereby
giving the debtor more time to pay, while also sometimes including
a personal guarantee by the owner of the debtor</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="height:57.6pt;vertical-align:bottom;width:1067pt;">The
payee is the party who receives payment under the terms of the
note, and the maker is the party obligated to send funds to the
payee. The amount of payment to be made, as listed in the terms of
the note, is the principal. The principal is to be paid on the
maturity date of the note.<br />
A note receivable usually includes a specific interest rate, or a
rate which is tied to another interest rate, such as a bank’s prime
rate. The calculation of the interest earned on a note receivable
is:<br />
Principal x Interest rate x Time period = Interest earned</td>

<td style="height:28.8pt;vertical-align:bottom;width:1067pt;">A
dishonored note is a promissory note that has not been paid by a
debtor in a reasonable amount of time, causing the creditor to
write off the recorded revenue as bad debt. If the debtor will not
likely pay the debt, such as when the debtor declares bankruptcy,
disappears or has debts that are beyond the statute of limitations,
the crediting company generally writes the debt off as operating
expenses.</td>
