                                        <p><strong>As per Chegg policy of first four sub portion have been answered.</strong></p> <p><strong>a. Snapchat&#39;s gross deferred tax assets increased during 2018. Two items casuing the increase:</strong></p> <p>As per the screenshot of net deferred tax balances shared the deferred tax has increased because of the following two accounts:</p> <p>a) Net operating losses</p> <p>b) Tax credit carryforwards</p> <p>These would be state and federal loss carry forwards and tax credit which have increased. The significant&nbsp;increase&nbsp;in &#39;losses before income taxes&#39; seems have increased significantly in 2018 as compared to 2017 which indicate possibility of additional deferred tax asset on net operating losses. Similarly, there is increase in tax credit available to the Company.</p> <p><strong>b. In 2017, Snapchat reported deferred tax liabilities. Explain how this liability arose</strong></p> <p>Deferred tax liability in 2017 is on account of property, plant and equipment. This would arise when certain portion of property, plant and equipment has already been claimed in tax books as an expense maybe in form of depreciation, however in the financial statement it would be subsequently be considered as an expense. Resulting in temporary difference in tax book and carrying value of property, plant and equipment in the financial statement and hence deferred tax liability.</p> <p><strong>c. Why does the Company record valuation allowance. Given the size of 2018 allowance what is the Company&#39;s expectation with future pretax income?</strong></p> <p>Valuation allowance are recognised when it is &#39;more likely than not&#39; that the deferred tax will not realised by the Company. It means that the Company is not expecting to enjoy the benefit of the deferred tax asset it currently has.</p> <p>Given the&nbsp;2018 allowance what is the Company&#39;s expectation with future pretax income, it seems that the Company would not generate sufficient future pretax income to set off the deferred tax asset it has recognised on losses and other items.</p> <p><strong>d. Explain how the valuation allowance affected 2018 net income</strong></p> <p>The recognition of deferred tax asset reduces the net tax expense in statement of total comprehensive income/statement of profit and loss and accordingly increases the net profit after tax. Recognition of valuation allowance will reverse this position and result in increase of net tax&nbsp;expense in statement of total comprehensive income/statement of profit and loss and accordingly decreases the net profit after tax.</p>
