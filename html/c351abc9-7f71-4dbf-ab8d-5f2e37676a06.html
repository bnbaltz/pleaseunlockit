true?</p>
<p>1. Qualitative traits are each determined by a single gene that
has a small number of alleles</p>
<p>2. When a gene has 2 alleles, the allele frequency in a
population move toward equilibrium values for 0.5 for each
allele</p>
<p>3. All else being equal, alleles associated with higher
reproductive success decrease in frequency</p>
<p>4. If the frequency of an allele in a population has changed
over generations, then evolution has occured</p>

                                        <p>Each gene has two alleles. Quantitative traits are the traits which are controlled by more than one genes. For example height of human beings.</p> <p>If there are two alleles in a population the frequency of each allele could be different. For example phenomenon like genetic drift causes fixation of alleles.</p> <p>Alleles which are associated with higher reproductive success generally tends to increase by natural selection because they offers evolutionary benefits.</p> <p>If the frequency of alleles have changed over several generations ot represents the population has evolved because of evolution. Change in frequency of alleles could be because of genetic drift, natural selection or mutation.</p> <p>So option D is correct&nbsp;</p>
