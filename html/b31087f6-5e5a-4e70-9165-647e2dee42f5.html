<p>Kubin Company’s relevant range of production is 18,000 to 22,000
units.</p>
<p>When it produces and sells 20,000 units, its average costs per
unit are as follows:</p>
<p>Average Cost per Unit Direct materials: $7.00</p>
<p>Direct labor: $4.00</p>
<p>Variable manufacturing overhead: $1.50</p>
<p>Fixed manufacturing overhead: $5.00</p>
<p>Fixed selling expense: $3.50</p>
<p>Fixed administrative expense: $2.50</p>
<p>Sales commissions: $1.00</p>
<p>Variable administrative expense: $0.50 Required:</p>
<p>1. Assume the cost object is units of production:</p>
<p>a. What is the total direct manufacturing cost incurred to make
20,000 units?</p>
<p>b. What is the total indirect manufacturing cost incurred to
make 20,000 units?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Assume the cost object is the Manufacturing Department and
that its total output is 20,000 units.</p>
<p>a. How much total manufacturing cost is directly traceable to
the Manufacturing Department?</p>
<p>b. How much total manufacturing cost is an indirect cost that
cannot be easily traced to the Manufacturing Department?</p>
<p>3. Assume the cost object is the company’s various sales
representatives. Furthermore, assume that the company spent $50,000
of its total fixed selling expense on advertising and the remainder
of the total fixed selling expense comprised the fixed portion of
the company’s sales representatives’ compensation.</p>
<p>a. When the company sells 20,000 units, what is the total direct
selling expense that can be readily traced to individual sales
representatives?</p>
<p>b. When the company sells 20,000 units, what is the total
indirect selling expense that cannot be readily traced to
individual sales representatives?</p>
<p>4. Are Kubin’s administrative expenses always going to be
treated as indirect costs in its internal management reports?</p>
