                                        <p>hCG refers to the <strong>Human&nbsp;Chorionic</strong>&nbsp; <strong>Gonadotrophic</strong> <strong>Hormone.&nbsp;</strong>It is a hormone secreted by the cells of the placenta after it forms as a result of fertilization of egg and can be tested to detect pregnancy. Thus it is also called as the pregnancy hormone.</p> <p>hCG is measured in mIU/ml i.e&nbsp;milli-international units&nbsp;per milliliter.</p> <p>Levels of hCG can be tested from urine sample or blood sample. Levels of HCG helps to detect the stage of the pregnancy and to determine the development of the foetus.</p> <p>At initial stages from the last missed periods, i.e after about 2 weeks of conception the HCG hormone levels are detected in blood that gradually increase from 5 mIU/ml to 50 mIU/ml.</p> <p>As days pass the doubling time of hormone levels become 48 hours to 96 hours.</p> <p>In the first trimester, hCG levels range from 5 mIU/ml to 253,000 mIU/ml. It is usually high towards the end of the first trimester.</p> <p>After that it maintains a stable amount or lowers slightly till child birth</p> <p>In the 2nd trimester HCG levels are from 4,060 to 165,400 mIU/ml.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the 3rd trimester,it is about 3,640 117,000 mIU/ml</p> <p>If hCG levels suddenly lowers to a single digit number, it indicates that a miscarriage can happen.</p> <p><strong>15</strong>&nbsp;) Here the data of&nbsp; blood HCG levels of 4 females is given.</p> <p>Now we know that the HCG hormone is released by the placental cells after conception can be detected in the blood after about 2 weeks of last missed periods. If the HCG levels is 0 to 25 mIU /ml, it is considered as a negative pregnancy test, while if it is above 25 mIU/ml, it is considered as a positive pregnancy test.</p> <p>As the patient 3 shows the 3 mIU/ml,&nbsp; she is most likely not be able to conceive.&nbsp;</p> <p>Patient 4 has level 15,392 mIU/ml thus she may be in 2nd trimester of her pregnancy.</p> <p>Therefore option (a) should be selected.</p> <p>Option (b) also has patient 3 as an answer but&nbsp; patient 2 has level 529 which is very low to be in 2nd trimester stage.Thus option (b) cannot be selected as answer.Also option (c) and (d) are incorrect.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>16</strong>) Although the ranges of HCG levels in different stages of pregnancy are predetermined by doctors, there is a variation in the levels from patient to patient and pregnancy to pregnancy.&nbsp;</p> <p>Thus on observing the HCG levels of 2 different patients, we cannot compare between them to determine their stages. Hence it is necessary to test the blood sample of each patient from time to time and individually compare the levels of HCG&nbsp; based on number of tests done to determine the stage of the respective female.</p> <p>Therefore option (a) should be selected as the answer.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>
