                                        <p><u><strong>Answer:</strong></u>-</p> <p><strong>The company was established as a result of Jeff Bezos&nbsp;regret minimization framework,&nbsp;which he coined to explain his attempts to avoid any regrets for not getting involved earlier in the Internet business boom at the time. Bezos resigned in 1994 as a vice president of D E Shaw and C company of Wall Street and moved to Seattle, Washington to develop a business plan for Amazon.com.. Bezos first founded the company in Washington state on July 5, 1994, under the name Cadabra, Inc. Since a lawyer misheard the original name as cadaver, he changed the name to Amazon.com, Inc after a few months.In its early days, the company operated out of Bezos&#39; garage on 28th Street Northeast in Bellevue, Washington, DC. In September 1994, he purchased the name for the domain relentless.com and thought briefly of naming his online store Relentless. The domain remains the property of Bezos and remains forwarded to the dealer.</strong></p> <p><strong>In other areas, the company expanded rapidly. The Associates Program, with other web sites offering merchandise for sale and Amazon, was established from 1996 to more than 350,000 by 1999, to fill the order and pay a commission. The company quickly began to sell more than books following Bezos&#39; initial strategy. In 1998, sales of music and video began. In the same year, the acquisition of online librarians in the United Kingdom and Germany began international operations. By 1999 it sold consumer electronics, video games, software, home-building products, toys and games, etc. Amazon.com needed more than private investors to support this growth. As a consequence, Amazon.com became a public company in May 1997, which raises $54 million on the NASDAQ market, less than two years after its virtually open doors to consumers and without ever making any profit. The company was able to use its highly volatile stock, in addition to cash, to finance its aggressive strategic growth and takeover.</strong></p> <p><strong>While expanding its product offerings broadened its reach, it was Amazon.com&#39;s service that earned the company customer loyalty and ultimately benefit. Its personalization software suggested other goods to buy based on a customer&#39;s purchase history as well as data from other customers of similar items. Its publication of product reviews cultivated a group of customers who assisted one another in finding everything from the right book to the best blender.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although offering more types of goods broadened its appeal, it was Amazon.com&#39;s service that earned it customer loyalty and ultimate profitability. Its customization tools recommended that other products be purchased on the basis of both the customer&#39;s purchase history and the purchaser&#39;s data of the same items. Its publication of customer reviews of products has encouraged a community of consumers who have helped each other to find everything from the right book to the best blender..</strong></p> <p><strong>The Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), which rents out computer processing power in small or large increments, was added to Amazon&#39;s AWS portfolio in 2006. The Simple Storage Service (S3), which rents out data storage over the Internet, was launched the same year. Bezos&#39; tactic when he created Amazon.com was to not bring any inventory. However, in 1997, the company started storing inventory in its warehouses in order to gain greater leverage over deliveries. In 2000, the company launched a service that enables small companies and individuals to sell their products through Amazon.com, and by 2006 it started its Amazon service, which manages the inventory of such businesses. Its growing inventory-management business has boosted its $775 million purchase in 2012 of Kiva Systems, a robotics company whose devices automate inventory-fulfillment tasks.</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>
