Explain your reasoning.</p>
<p>MORE INFORMATION TO ANSWER THE QUESTION:In 1965, President
Lyndon B. Johnson opened a new offensive against organized crime by
establish- ing the Presidentâ€™s Commission on Law Enforcement and
the Administration of Justice. Headed by Attorney General Nicholas
Katzenbach, the commission analyzed the federal failure to cope
with organized crime, and in its 1967 final report offered more
than 200 suggestions for combating crime. These recommendations
prompted two major pieces of legislation. The Crime Control and
Safe Streets Act of 1968 made it easier to gather evidence about
organized crime enterprises by authorizing court-ordered electronic
surveillance at both federal and state levels. Two years later, in
1970, President Richard Nixon signed into law the Organized Crime
Control Act, which granted greater powers to grand juries,
permitted the detention of unmanageable witnesses, and authorized
the attorney general to protect cooperative federal and state
witnesses and their families. In the 1980s, much of crime control
legislation focused on the illicit drug trade. The Crime Control
Act of 1984 expanded the authority of criminal and civil asset
forfeiture laws and implemented a federally determined sentencing
system for convicted offenders. Two years later, the 1986 Anti-Drug
Abuse Act established mandatory prison sentences for large-scale
distribution of marijuana and imposed strict sentences for
money-laundering activities. Among other things, it added designer
drugs to the list of controlled substance.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <p>In my views, the drafting of Organized Crime Control Act helped
in strengthening the combat to organized crimes. This act was
passed in the year 1970 to put restrictions on organized crimes.
Strict penal prohibitions were established and stringent policies
were laid to prevent the occurrence of any kind of organized
crime.</p>
<p>However, this act may not be very effective as the regulatory
body is not very stringent in monitoring the occurrence. &nbsp;The
organized crimes happen under scheming impact of criminals and
establishing a regulation may become very difficult.</p>
