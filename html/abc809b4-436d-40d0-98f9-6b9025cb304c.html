                                    <p>10. An investment advisor at Shore Financial Services wants to
develop a model that can be used to allocate investment funds among
four alternatives: stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and cash. For the
coming investment period, the company developed estimates of the
annual rate of return and the associated risk for each alternative.
Risk is measured using an index between 0 and 1, with higher risk
values denoting more volatility and thus more uncertainty.</p>

<p>Because cash is held in a money market fund, the annual return
is lower, but it carries essentially no risk. The objective is to
determine the portion of funds allocated to each investment
alternative in order to maximize the total annual return for the
portfolio subject to the risk level the client is willing to
tolerate. Total risk is the sum of the risk for all investment
alternatives. For instance, if 40% of a client’s funds are invested
in stocks, 30% in bonds, 20% in mutual funds, and 10% in cash, the
total risk for the portfolio would be 0.40(0.8) 0.30(0.2) 0.20(0.3)
0.10(0.0) 0.44. An investment advisor will meet with each client to
discuss the client’s investment objectives and to determine a
maximum total risk value for the client. A maximum total risk value
of less than 0.3 would be assigned to a conservative investor; a
maximum total risk value of between 0.3 and 0.5 would be assigned
to a moderate tolerance to risk; and a maximum total risk value
greater than 0.5 would be assigned to a more aggressive investor.
Shore Financial Services specified additional guidelines that must
be applied to all clients. The guidelines are as follows: •</p>
<p>• No more than 75% of the total investment may be in stocks. •
The amount invested in mutual funds must be at least as much as
invested in bonds. • The amount of cash must be at least 10%, but
no more than 30% of the total investment funds.</p>
<p>a. Suppose the maximum risk value for a particular client is
0.4. What is the optimal allocation of investment funds among
stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and cash? What is the annual rate of
return and the total risk for the optimal portfolio?</p>
<p>b. Suppose the maximum risk value for a more conservative client
is 0.18. What is the optimal allocation of investment funds for
this client? What is the annual rate of return and the total risk
for the optimal portfolio?</p>
<p>c. Another more aggressive client has a maximum risk value of
0.7. What is the optimal allocation of investment funds for this
client? What is the annual rate of return and the total risk for
the optimal portfolio?</p>
<p>d. Refer to the solution for the more aggressive client in part
(c). Would this client be interested in having the investment
advisor increase the maximum percentage allowed in stocks or
decrease the requirement that the amount of cash must be at least
10% of the funds invested? Explain.</p>
<p>e. What is the advantage of defining the decision variables as
is done in this model rather than stating the amount to be invested
and expressing the decision variables directly in dollar
amounts?</p>
