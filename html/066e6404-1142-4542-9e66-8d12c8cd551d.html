                                        <p>How do strategic goals relate to critical success factors?
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Answer :&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Critical Success Factors : The factors which are very crucial
&amp; important to improve the overall performance of
organization.</p>
<p>Following are the&nbsp;critical success factors :&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Do a Present- condition analysis before hopping into
future-state preparation</li>
<li>Engage Staffs Across the Association In Strategic
Preparation</li>
<li>Bring into line strategy with mission, working tactics and
business procedures</li>
<li>Bring into line &nbsp;strategic areas with metrics, events</li>
<li>Implement strategy supremacy and keep it humble</li>
<li>Utilize a Alteration Management package throughout strategy
application</li>
<li>Bring into line &nbsp;the strategy and goals with the
establishmentâ€™s culture and essential values</li>
<li>Do not supervise short-term structural fixes that must be
spoken in order for long-term achievement to happen&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>etc</p>
<p>2 ) Meaning of Strategic Goals :&nbsp;</p>
<p>Strategic goals are declarations of what you request to attain
over the time of the strategic plan (e.g. over the following year,
5 years, 10 years.) They reproduce the examination you do that
twitches with making a dream, a role declaration and a mission
declaration, and then your examination of your setting, SWOT
analysis.</p>
<p>Now if we see the Point no 1 &amp; Point No 2 , these points are
related with each other. See When organizations wants to improve.
That organization need to focus on some critical factors .Analysis
of these critical factors helps to organization for finding of loop
holes as well as to prepare for SWOT analysis.Now what are the
critical factors. All these critical factors we have mentioned in
point 1. If we see to all these &nbsp;factors .In these factors 8
points or more that that directly or indirectly associated with
strategy goals , strategy formation , strategy implementation.</p>
<p>That means when organizations are setting , deciding the
strategies , they must think of the success factor &amp; vice
versa.</p>
<p>See this is pure tool of Top management decision. Top management
goes hand in hand by considering Strategy goals &amp; Critical
success factors. Thats why&nbsp;strategic goals are &nbsp;related
&nbsp;to critical success factors</p>
