                                    <p>You work for a Philippine-based textile company struggling with
overseas competitors that have access to low cost labor. While you
pay your factory workers Php 200 an hour plus benefits, you know
that a similar textile mill in Vietnam is paying its employees
about Php 50 an hour, and the mill does not have to comply with the
same safety and environmental regulations that your company does.
Although your mill is marginally profitable, the Vietnamese factory
clearly has a cost advantage. Your CEO wants to move production to
Vietnam where labor and compliance costs are lower, resulting in
mill closure and employee layoffs. Your mill is the only large
employer in a small community. Many of the employees have worked
there their entire working lives. What is the right action to take
for stockholders?<br>
<br>
<br>
Questions: As a stakeholder, give at least three (3) alternative of
actions that would address this problem. What is the most ethical
course of action? Is there a conflict here?</p>

                                        <p>As a stakeholder,the right approach to take would include the following-</p> <ul> 	<li>Keep the factory where it is as the employees are hugely dependent on it.</li> 	<li>Introduce international workers to the factory which may work at a lesser cost and therefore maintain a balance between the two.</li> 	<li>Introduce some level of automation in the old factory so that it isn&#39;t to be moved while the cost reduction scope increases.</li> </ul> <p>The most ethical course of action is to keep the factory as it because the practice of vietnam is against the humane treatment and ethics of work.Therefore,it would affect the company perception negatively.The conflict is created between the profitability and goodwill.However in my opinion goodwill should be carried along and given more preferance over small time profit.</p>
