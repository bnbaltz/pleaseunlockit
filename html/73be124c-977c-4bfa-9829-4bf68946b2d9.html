                                    <br>
                                </h4>
                                <div class="row">

                                        <p>1. In the first case, the demand for Under Armour Athletic
clothes will increase as now there will be increase in the
consumers from all the universities and colleges which have to wear
this company clothing after the signing of the deal with NCAA.
There will be increase in the demand hence a rightward shift.</p>
<p>2. Here the supply will get effected because when the price of
synthetic fiber increases which is used as input by the company,
its cost increases hence effects supply shifting it leftward termed
as increase in supply.</p>
<p>3.This is technological innovation which brings down the cost
hence effecting supply side, by increasing it and seen as rightward
shift in supply curve.</p>
<p>4. When the price of Nike Athletic Clothing rises which is a
substitute for this company that people find Under Armour Clothing
relatively cheaper and purchase&nbsp;from it rather than Nike hence
increasing demand for this and seen as rightward shift in demand
curve.</p>
<p>5. When a stock market crashed reduces people income, they cut
down their expenses, hence reduces demand shown as leftward shift
in demand curve and called Decrease In demand.</p>
<p>P.S. In all these cases when one curve shifts either demand or
supply we are saying nothing about the other curve because we cant
say with certainty about it.</p>
<p>Q2. In reference to the figure</p>
<p>Consumer Surplus is what consumers get in excess of their
willingness to pay to the price paid while producer surplus is in
excess what they get to what they were willing to supply at.</p>
<p>After imports opened up and market prices reduces to world price
the consumer surplus has to increase as prices are lowered and now
more area is covered under their demand curve(which measures their
willingness to pay) and opposite for producers whose supply also
reduced and quantity compensated by imports and now more quantity
sold from 4 to 6, 2 from the domestic suppliers while (6-2) = 4 by
importers.</p>
<p>so technically yes consumer surplus has risen, domestic producer
fallen, total Surplus risen in graph but behind the scenes one
thing should be taken care for the area of triangle E and D are
actually also the revenue of the importers which are given away
from the country so hence can be seen as nullyfying any increase in
total surplus still = A+B+C just yes the net consumer surplus
increase from A to A+B where B is what is transferred from
producers to consumers and hence a definite fall in producer
surplus from B+C to C, again mentioning total surplus remaining
unchanged due to D+E actually depletion from nation's income to the
importers of other countries.<img alt="Dus
