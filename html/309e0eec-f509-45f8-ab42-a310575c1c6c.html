                                        <p>Gas Thermometers and the Absolute Temperature------ When different thermometers are calibrated at the ice-point and steam-point temperatures, they give slightly different readings at the points between. Discrepancies increase markedly above and below this range. Exceptions are the constant-volume gas thermometers, for which the measured temperatures agree closely even far from the calibration points. In these thermometers the volume is kept constant and the change in gas pressure is used to measure the temperature (Figure 17-4 of Tipler-Mosca). For the Celsius scale: tC = Pt &minus; P0 P100 &minus; P0 &times; 100◦C . The agreement between different gas thermometers is best at low gas densities. Figure 17-6 of Tipler-Mosca shows a plot of measured temperature versus pressure for a constant-volume gas thermometer at very low density. When we extrapolate the straight line towards zero pressure, the temperature approaches the absolute zero at T0 = &minus;273.15◦C . 4 A reference point that is more precisely reproducible than either the ice or the steam points is the triple point of water. This is the unique temperature and pressure at which water, water vapor and ice coexist in equilibrium, namely at 0.01◦C and P3 = 4.58 mmHg. The Kelvin or ideal gas temperature scale is defined so that the triple point is at 273.16K and the absolute zero temperature is at 0K: T = 273.16 K P3 P where P is the observed pressure of the gas thermometer. The lowest temperature that can be measured with a gas thermometer is about 1K, and requires helium. Below this temperature helium liquefies and all other gases liquefy at higher temperatures. Later, we use the second law of thermodynamics to define the absolute temperature scale without reference to the properties of a particular substance. Temperatures as low at 10&minus;6K have been measured this way. To convert from Celsius to Kelvin one merely adjusts the absolute zero temperature: T = tC K/C + 273.15 K . The absolute (Kelvin) temperature scale is most convenient for scientific purposes. 5 The Ideal-Gas Law Experimental results by Robert Boyle (1627-1691), Jacques Charles (1746-1823) and Gay-Lussac (1778-1850) for a fixed amount of gas combine to the equation P V = C T where P is the pressure, V is the volume, T is the absolute temperature and C is a proportionality constant. We see that C is proportional to the volume by doubling the amount of gas, while holding the pressure and temperature constant. Therefore, we write C = k N, where k is a constant and N the number of molecules in the gas. Then, we have P V = N k T . The constant k is called Boltzmann constant and found experimentally to be k = 1.381 &times; 10&minus;23 J/K = 8.617 &times; 10&minus;5 ev/K 6 An amount of gas is often expressed in moles. A mole (mol) is the amount of a substance that contains Avogadro&rsquo;s number NA of molecule, defined as the number of carbon atoms in 12 g of 12C: NA = 6.022 &times; 1023 . If we have n moles of a substance, the number of molecules is then N = n NA. The constant R = NA k = 8.314 J/mol &middot; K = 0.08206 L &middot; atm/mol &middot; K is called universal gas constant. The pressure, volume, and temperature of an ideal gas are related by P V = n NA k T = n R T . The variables P, V , and T describe the macroscopic state of a gas. The microscopic state would be described by giving the position and velocity of each molecule of the gas. An equation which relates the macroscopic state variables is called an equation of state. 7 At higher densities corrections must be made to the ideal gas law. The van der Waals equation, discussed in Chapter 20 of Tipler-Mosca, includes such corrections. The temperature of 0 ◦C (273 K) and the pressure of 1 atm are often referred to as standard conditions. Under standard conditions 1 mol of an ideal gas occupies a volume of 22.4 L. &nbsp;Tipler-Mosca shows plots of P versus V for several constant temperatures. These curves are called isotherms. For a fixed amount of gas we have P2 V2 T2 = P1 V1 T1 = n R where the subscripts label two different macroscopic states.</p> <p>Normal Boiling Point (NBP)</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The temperature at which the&nbsp;vapor pressure&nbsp;of a liquid reaches 760 mm of mercury, or 1 atmosphere (1013 hPa)</p> <p>&nbsp;we have a thermometer that we can use to measure the temperature of a gas. We suppose that this thermometer uses a liquid, and we define an increase in temperature by the increase in the volume of this liquid. Our statement of Charles&rsquo; law asserts that the volume of a gas is a linear function of the volume of the liquid in our thermometer, and that the same linear function is observed for any gas&nbsp;</p> <p>here is a problem with this statement. Careful experiments with such thermometers produce results that deviate from Charles&rsquo; law. With sufficiently accurate volume measurements, this occurs to some extent for any choice of the liquid in the thermometer. If we make sufficiently accurate measurements, the volume of a gas is not exactly proportional to the volume of any liquid (or solid) that we might choose as the working substance in our thermometer. That is, if we base our temperature scale on a liquid or solid substance, we observe deviations from Charles&rsquo; law. There is a further difficulty with using a liquid as the standard fluid on which to base our temperature measurements: temperatures outside the liquid range of the chosen substance have to be measured in some other way.</p> <p>Evidently, we can choose to use a gas as the working fluid in our thermometer. That is, our gas-volume measuring device is itself a thermometer. This fact proves to be very useful because of a further experimental observation. To a very good approximation, we find: If we keep the pressures in the thermometer and in some other gaseous system constant at low enough values, both gases behave as ideal gases, and we find that the volumes of the two gases are proportional to each other over any range of temperature. Moreover, this proportionality is observed for any choice of either gas. This means that we can define temperature in terms of the expansion of any constant-pressure gas that behaves ideally. In principle, we can measure the same temperature using any gas, so long as the constant operating pressure is low enough. When we do so, our device is called the&nbsp;<strong><em>ideal gas&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>thermometer</em></strong>. In so far as any gas behaves as an ideal gas at a sufficiently low pressure, any real gas can be used in an ideal gas thermometer and to measure any temperature accurately. Of course, practical problems emerge when we attempt to make such measurements at very high and very low temperatures.</p>
