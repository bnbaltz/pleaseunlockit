multidimensional. What does she mean? Next, briefly discuss the difference between dominant and subordinate<br>
groups. What is a current example of subordinate group and explain what makes this group a subordinate one. Why<br>
does Tatum think that an individual who belongs to the dominant group will less likely identify themselves as a member<br>
of this group than a person who belongs to a subordinate group?</p>

                                        <p>In her article, Complexity of Identity: Who Am I, Beverly Tatum analyzes the intricacy of individuality, and the aspects of your socialization that shape our place in a global community. Tatum discusses three main concepts: that who we are is both shaped by how we see ourselves and how others see us, that we tend to overlook our dominant traits, and the norms of society are usually set by the dominant groups. She addresses these issues in order to convey the idea that who we are is a reflection of how society sees us, and that actively omitting information that puts us within the realm of dominant groups is an attempt to deny that. Tatum references the &ldquo;looking glass self&rdquo; claiming it is not a flat one-dimensional reflection, but multidimensional, shaped by one&rsquo;s racial identity, sex, age, wealth, sexual orientation, health, and religion.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>For most of our lives we believe we are who we want to be, and with this text Beverly Tatum challenges the idea of free-destiny and choice. Her ideas that we are not only a manifestation of our society but that we attempt to cast off our dominate traits in order to victimize ourselves, giving a glimpse of just how far from the truth we are when we give ourselves the title of &ldquo;individual&rdquo; today.</p> <p>As a white, able bodied, middle class, heterosexual woman my social status elevates me and gives me certain advantages at the expense of those who do not possess those particular characteristics. I remain dominate because I am a part of the majority; a majority which makes little compromise and has minimal inclusion of subordinate practices. Tatum&rsquo;s concept of subordinate groups having to work within the walls of the dominate standards rings true today in our day to day lives. I have never had to make any sacrifices, taken off work or school, for religions that are a minority in the United States; yet, minority religions are constantly bombarded with western (Christian) religious concepts in the form of holidays and even the way we pledge allegiance in the United States. Her commentary though is little more than commentary, there isn&rsquo;t much of a solution presented in this specific excerpt. This leaves the statement at merely a statement, and does not bring the analyses full circle.</p>
