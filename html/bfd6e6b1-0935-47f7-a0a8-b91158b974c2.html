  <p>If the function h(t) isalinear function of population size h(t) = Ex(t), the model is x' = f(x)- Ex. This type of harvesting is called proportional or constant effort harvesting. It arises in the modeling of fisheries, where it is often assumed that x,&nbsp;</p>

  <p>If the population is governed by a logistic model the harvested model is ~~ = rx( 1- ~) -Ex, and there are two equilibria, one at x = 0 and one obtained by solving r(l- xjK)- E = 0, which we denote by x 00 (E) = K(r- E)jr, provided 0 :::; E:::; r. It is easy to verify that the equilibrium at x = 0 is unstable and the equilibrium at x 00 (E) is asymptotically stable for 0 :::; E :::; r. As the effort increases from zero to r, the equilibrium decreases from K to zero. Fora given effort E the yield is Ex 00 (E) = KE-KE2 jr. This yield attains a maximum value of rK/4 for E = r/2, with x 00 (E) = K/2; increasing the effort beyond r /2 is counter productive in that it decreases the yield. Forageneralmodel x' = f(x)- Ex the equilibria are found by solving f(x) -Ex = 0, that is by finding values x 00 (E) of x where the growth curve y = f(x) and the harvest curve y =Ex intersect. An equilibrium is asymptotically stable if (f(x)- Ex)~=x= = f'(x 00 )-E &lt; 0, that is, if at such an intersection the growth curve crosses the harvest curve from above to below as x increases. If /(0) = 0 then x = 0 is an equilibrium which is unstable unless x = 0 is the only equilibrium. Fora given effort E the yield is Y = Ex 00 (E) = F(x00 ), and the maximum yield is maxF(x), obtained with E = Emax chosen so that the line y =Ex passes through the maximum of F(x).&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>as given K=194,600, r=0.0987^-1 and h= 3000 bird per year&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>then put all values in the equation and get the equilibrium</p>
