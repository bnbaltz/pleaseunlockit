                                    <p>The primary purpose of managerial accounting is to provide
information useful for management decisions. Many of the managerial
accounting techniques that you learn in this course will be useful
for decisions you make in your everyday life. After you graduate,
one of the next important decisions you'll have to make is where to
work. Instructions Suppose that you go for job interviews and are
given an offer of employment by two competing firms for the same
entry-level position. They are offering the same salary and
benefits. Their offices are in different cities. They are both
public companies, so their annual reports containing financial and
other information are available to you for free on their websites.
For each of the following factors, provide an example of the
numerical information you would need to help decide which firm to
work for. (a)&nbsp;&nbsp; Which company is currently more
profitable (b)&nbsp;&nbsp; Which city is more economical to live in
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp; Which company has better long-term prospects
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp; Which company might have more opportunities for
advancement.</p>
