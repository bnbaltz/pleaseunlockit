In rotational dynamics, you must calculate the net torque about an axis to determine an objects rotational motion. In linear dynamics, you learned aborut the conservation of momentum. Not surprisingly,in rotational dynamics there is conservation of angular momentum. could go on for hundreds of pages, but luckily your textbook already does this. We Even though mass is analogous to moment of inertia in the formulas, the two have very different physical properties moment of inertia depends on the distribution of mass (that is,the shape) of the object. The moment of inertia on the location of the axis the object is rotating (spin-axis),Mass measurements are obtained using a balance of inertia measurements are not as easily accomplished. Indeed it is a litle more involved, but its also more fun. PART 1: MEASURING THE MOMENT OF INERTIA To measure the moment of inertia, we use a turntable with string wrapped around it. The string loops over a pulley and attaches to a hanging mass. The weight of the mass creates a tension in the string.This tension force exerts a torque on the turntable that makes it rotate. By calculating the angular acceleration of the turntable and torque on the turntable, we can calculate the moment of inertia. Torque The torque exerted on an object by a force, E, is equal to the lever arm distance (the distance from the axis of rotation to where the force acts) multiplied by the component of force perpendicular to the lever arm. pivot Figune 12- Trque is equal to the perpendicalar force multiplied by the distance from the axis of rotation When you attach a mass to the string on the turntable and release it, the force exerting the torque on the turntable is the tension in the string. In this experiment, you are to adjust your apparatus so that the string makes an angle of 90 turntable and that the pulley is at the same height as the top of the turntable. /2 radians with the Question 1.1 What is the formula for the torque on the turntable in terms of tension in the string and the lever arm distance?

<p>Q 1.2</p>
<p>there is no slipping of rope on the turntable so linear
acceleration and angular acceleration are related by this
relation.</p>
<p>Q 1.3</p>
<p>arm lever distance also includes the radius of string so if
diameter changes - radius changes = torque on turntable
changes.</p>
<p>Q 1.4</p>
<p>it mean how accurate we can measure the distance. let we have an
instrument which have least count X mm , i.e. we can measure
smallest distance of X mm. in this case we are accurate upto X mm
(confidence level of measurement)</p>
