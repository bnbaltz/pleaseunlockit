According to Gerber, the company received the highest customer loyalty rating out of 3,500 U.S. corporate and product brands, topping companies such as Nike and Coca-Cola. To parents around the world, the Gerber baby means quality, and the Gerber Company has long been a leader in using quality tools to uphold its reputation.

The company began in the Gerber family kitchen in 1927. Aftler watching her husbands messy attempt at straining peas for their daughter, Dorothy Gerber suggested that the task would be better accomplished at the family-owned canning plant.
