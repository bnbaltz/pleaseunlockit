                                        <p>Remember that the map units are actually recombination frequencies, so your distances here are indicating you the frequencies, let us address each case:</p> <p>A) In this case the parents are BG and bg, and we are looking for bg, then we require no recombination, the distance between b and g is 9, that means the probability of no recombination s 100 - 9 = 91, then we have to divide that number by 2 (because half of the non recombinants are BG and the other half is our bg), that is 91/2 = 45.5.</p> <p>The answer then is 45.5%</p> <p>B) The parents are aM and Am, and we require the frequency of AM, that means we require recombination, the distance between a and m is 60 mu. Remember to divide the number by 2, so 60/2 = 30. The answer is then 30%</p> <p>C) The parents are bGr and BgR, and we require BGR, in this case we require a double recombination event to get what we want. The distance between b and g is 9, while between g and r is 20. The probability of a double crossover is the product of both probabilities:</p> <p>(0.09)(0.2) = 0.018</p> <p>Now, remember to divide the number by 2, the answer then is 0.9%</p> <p>D) The parents are bGr and BgR, and we require Bgr, we need a single recombination event between g and r to achieve it, the distance is 20, then you have to divide 20 by 2, that is 20/2 = 10. The answer is 10%</p> <p>E) Now the parents are AEH and aeh and we require AeH, again we require a double recombination to get this, the distance between a and e is 3, and between e and h is 64.&nbsp;</p> <p>(0.03)(0.64) = 0.0192</p> <p>Now, let us divide by 2, that is 0.0096, which is 0.96%</p>
