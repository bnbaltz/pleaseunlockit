school can be extremely difficult at times. The university is
trying to determine the location of a new parking garage. As part
of their research, officials are interested in estimating the
average parking time of students from within the various colleges
on campus. A survey of 338 College of Business (COBA) students
yields the following descriptive information regarding the length
of time (in minutes) it took them to find a parking spot. Use it to
answer the following questions. Note that the “Lo 95%” and “Up 95%”
refer to the endpoints of the desired confidence
interval.</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;">5-1. Give a practical
interpretation for the 95% confidence interval given above.</p>
<p>A. We are 95% confident that the average parking time of all
COBA students falls between 9.19 and 11.74 minutes.</p>
<p>B. 95% of the COBA students had parking times of 10.466
minutes.</p>
<p>C. We are 95% confident that the average parking time of the 338
COBA students surveyed falls between 9.19 and 11.74 minutes.</p>
<p>D. 95% of the COBA students had parking times that fell between
9.19 and 11.74 minutes.</p>
<p style="margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;">5-2. Explain what the
phrase “95% confident” means when working with a confidence
interval.</p>
<p>A. In repeated sampling, 95% of the sample means will fall
within the interval created.</p>
<p>B. 95% of the observations in the population will fall within
the endpoints of the interval.</p>
<p>C. In repeated sampling, 95% of the population means will fall
within the interval created.</p>
<p>D. In repeated sampling, 95% of the intervals created will
contain the population mean.</p>
