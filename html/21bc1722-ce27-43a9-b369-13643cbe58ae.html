                                        <p><strong>An optimal capital structure is the objectively best mix
of debt, preferred stock, and common stock that maximizes a
company’s market value while minimizing its cost of
capital.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In theory, debt financing offers the lowest cost of
capital due to its tax deductibility. However, too much debt
increases the financial risk to shareholders and the&nbsp;return on
equity&nbsp;that they require. Thus, companies have to find the
optimal point at which the marginal benefit of debt equals the
marginal cost.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The optimal capital structure is estimated by
calculating the mix of debt and equity that minimizes the weighted
average cost of capital (WACC) while maximizing its market value.
The lower the cost of capital, the greater the present value of the
firm’s future cash flows, discounted by the WACC. Thus, the chief
goal of any corporate finance department should be to find the
optimal capital structure that will result in the lowest WACC and
the maximum value of the company (shareholder wealth).</strong></p>
<p><strong>The <span style=
"text-decoration: underline">Modigilani-Miller</span> (M&amp;M)
theorem is a capital structure approach named after&nbsp;Franco
Modigliani&nbsp;and&nbsp;Merton Miller&nbsp;. Modigliani and Miller
were two economics professors who studied capital structure theory
and collaborated to develop the capital-structure irrelevance
proposition. This proposition states that in perfect markets the
capital structure a company uses doesn't matter because the market
value of a firm is determined by its earning power and the risk of
its underlying assets. According to Modigliani and Miller, value is
independent of the method of financing used and a company's
investments.&nbsp;The&nbsp;M&amp;M theorem&nbsp;made two
propositions:</strong></p>
<p>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Proposition I:&nbsp;This proposition says that the
capital structure is irrelevant to the value of a firm. The value
of two identical firms would remain the same and value would not be
affected by the choice of finance adopted to finance the assets.
The value of a firm is dependent on the expected future earnings.
It is when there are no taxes.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Proposition II:&nbsp;This proposition says that the
financial leverage boosts the value of a firm and reduces WACC. It
is when tax information is available</strong></li>
</ul>
