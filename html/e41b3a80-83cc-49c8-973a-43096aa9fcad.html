Since the FDIC insures your account against bank failure, it is 100% certain that you will receive this money at the end of the period.</p> </div></div><div class="col"><div class="answer"> <p> <u>Option 2</u> </p> <p>Investing $10,000 in a corporate bond that earns 5% may seem like a good idea, except that there is a 10% chance that the company could go bankrupt. First we need to calculate the stated return of the investment, which is 5%:<img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/466/4664a0c4-7c34-46d7-a22d-fcc4c094cdd1/7119-2-23AP-i3.png" />. </p> <p>Furthermore, at the end of the period, you will have a total of: <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/e8b/e8b45cbd-d740-4688-921a-ecb1a721270f/7119-2-23AP-i4.png" /> <i>if</i> the company does <u>not</u> go bankrupt, which is 90% of the time. Suppose the company does bankrupt with this 10% chance, you will lose both the stated return and the initial $10,000 investment and have a payoff of $0 at the end of the p.</p> </div></div><div class="col"><div class="answer"> <p>Therefore, we need to calculate the expected return of this bond to incorporate for the chance that the company does go bankrupt as follows: <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/b6b/b6b493b0-3a8d-4ba4-ba8e-bdb0bdb60c6d/7119-2-23AP-i5.png" />. This is your expected return from investing in option 2.</p> </div></div><div class="col"><div class="answer"> <p> <u>Option 3</u> </p> <p>Similar to how we calculated expected return for option 2, first we need to calculate the agreed-upon return of the investment, which is 8%: <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/db9/db92ddd9-b9e1-40d2-8bf7-8e9cd508bf95/7119-2-23AP-i6.png" />.

This is your expected return from lending the money as stated in option 3.</p> </div></div><div class="col"><div class="answer"> <p> <u>Option 4</u> </p> <p>Holding the money in cash will earn you no interest, but will also keep the money safe because you will not suffer any risks that come with investments similar to options 2 and 3 (option 1 is risk-free because the FDIC insures the account). The expected return from this option is <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/269/26922c4d-1300-4071-a31d-0e438021e1ee/7119-2-23AP-i9.png" />.</p> </div></div><div class="col"><div class="answer"> <p>a. Suppose you are risk-neutral, meaning that you neither seek out nor shy away from risk. You would choose the option that has the highest expected return. As calculated above, that would be<img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/b01/b01b6e18-4f9b-40b0-b88b-6fd2bfe3c759/7119-2-23AP-i10.png" />.</p> </div></div><div class="col"><div class="answer"> <p>b.

Now suppose that we are given the option to pay $100 to obtain extra information about Mike that would indicate with certainty whether he will leave town without paying or not. With this information, we would know for sure if Mike decides to leave and give us a payoff of $0 or if he would repay his debt and give us a payoff of: <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/d5d/d5d9b6f5-352b-42fa-a35d-a4e3ad49c5bc/7119-2-23AP-i12.png" />.</p> </div></div><div class="col"><div class="answer"> <p>This information is extremely valuable to us because if Mike does repay his debt with the agreed-upon interest rate of 8%, we would still gain $700 after paying the friend the $100 fee. Loaning to Mike would be the better option because not doing so will make you miss the $700 profit. This tells us that better information regarding risk is<img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/093/0938be93-0089-44eb-b0ff-ea1bdb6aeddb/7119-2-23AP-i13.png" />.</p></div></div></div>
