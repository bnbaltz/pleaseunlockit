However, I have uploaded 150 luggages in 13 minutes that is I saved 2 minutes. Hence, basically I did my work efficiently. Therefore, instead of shouting at me he/she must be appreciated me for the work done. Due to his/her bad behavior employeeâ€™s loose motivation to work better leads to discouragement and bad work environment for them.</p> </div></div><div class="col"><div class="answer"> <p>This scenario relate to largest issues of how company design its control system. As there is no proper check on the efficiency of the workers, bench mark set was not updated according to change in work scenario. Further, employees are not updated with the time they have to complete the work. So it leads to very poor design of control system and overall management of the companies. </p> </div></div><div class="col"><div class="answer"> <p>This would lead to larger labor turnover, high employee recruitment cost, loss in value of services provided by the company and many more. For every company to do better in work it must have proper installed Control System.</p></div></div></div>
