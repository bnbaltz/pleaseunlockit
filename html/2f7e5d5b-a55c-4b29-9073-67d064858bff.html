                                        <p><strong>Strategic plans</strong> are designed &nbsp;keeping
broader picture of entire organization in mind aligned with vision
and mission of the company. People who are involved in making
strategic plans involve Board of Directors, CEO, CFO , President of
divisions etc . They will design and execute strategic plans to
paint a picture of the desired future and long-term goals of the
organization. Essentially, strategic plans look ahead to where the
organization wants to be in three, five, even ten years. Strategic
plans, provided by top-level managers, serve as the framework for
lower-level planning.</p>
<p>Tactical planning takes a company's strategic plan and sets
forth specific short-term actions and plans, usually by company
department or function. The tactical planning horizon is shorter
than the strategic plan horizon</p>
<p>Thus Strategic plan at execution stage is broken into multiple
tactical plans/ short term plans</p>
<p>Hill’s Plan of moving into as many markets as possible by
leveraging their expertise in environmental engineering has
following characteristics :</p>
<ol>
<li>A Strategic initiative in nature which leverages on company’s
strength in environmental engineering</li>
<li>The&nbsp; plan is long term in nature since it wants to
maximize number of markets which is possible only in the long
run</li>
</ol>
<p>Because of above reason , Hill’s plan is a “Strategic Plan”</p>
