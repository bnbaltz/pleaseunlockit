<p>The five main processes of project scope management provide the
foundation for a manager or team leader to develop a cohesive and
well-developed plan. &nbsp;While each step is highly important in
its own right, collecting the requirements is the first and most
difficult step in project scope management. &nbsp;This process is
necessary to complete before hand because all of the future steps
in a project depend on it. &nbsp;Collecting requirements will help
the project manager in the next step, which is â€“ defining the scope
of the project. &nbsp;A mistake made in this beginning stage early
on in the project can prove to be extremely costly as the project
enters the execution phase. &nbsp;For example, fixing defects in
software development projects can consume up to half the project
costs (Schwalbe, 2010). &nbsp;Figure 5-2 on page 180 of the text
provides a chart detailing the staggering costs that can be
associated with the need to correct defects in the project.
&nbsp;As each stage progresses, the cost of corrections will
increase dramatically which is why a well developed list of
requirements has the potential to be the life or death of the
project. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a multiple ways for a project manager working on a
project to develop a new or enhanced system for students to find
jobs at a University to collect requirements for this type of
project. &nbsp;First and foremost, the manager should have a
meeting with all the project stakeholders either in a group meeting
or conduct one-on-one interviews with the stakeholders to get a
broad sense of the overall major requirements of the project.
&nbsp;While it may provide a greater source of knowledge to meet
with as many people as possible, the interviews are performed with
the stakeholders due to the high number of users at the University,
which saves a large amount of time and money. &nbsp;Another
approach and one of the best ways to reach the masses would be to
conduct either online or paper surveys with the potential end users
of the system which in this case would be college students.
&nbsp;The use of questionnaires would be an inexpensive and very
fast method for a project manager to get a sense of what students
expect or want to see in a job search system. &nbsp;A third method
to gather project requirements would be to design small prototypes
and to observe how the users of the system would interact with
them</p>
