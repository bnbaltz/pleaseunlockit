                                        <p>Unilever, in Brazil, initially marketed its products by
targeting it at Black people in the similar fashion that proved
effective for the company in USA. But this marketing effort of
Unilever was shunned by the Black Brazilians. Unilever had ignored
the basic fact that Black Brazilians were socioculturally different
from the American Blacks.</p>
<p>Unilever later marketed its products in Brazil after
acknowledging the differences. For instance in Brazil (compared to
America) Blacks were better integrated into the society, were not
as discriminated as in USA and racial self identification was not
very strong.</p>
<p>Thus Unilever targeted the black population in Brazil by
targeting the entire population rather than certain segments. This
was due to the fact that Brazil’s blacks do not think of themselves
as being simply black but as falling into a range of skin
tones.</p>
<p>In Brazil the company is using a localization approach in
marketing. Its advertisements show people with different skin tones
and not just blacks or whites. Globally, due to increased level of
competition the company uses a global standardization
strategy.&nbsp;</p>
