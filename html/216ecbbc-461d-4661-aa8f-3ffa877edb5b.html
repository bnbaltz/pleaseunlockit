                                    <p>George Castro told Ambrosio Medrano that a bribe to a certain
corrupt Los Angeles County official would buy a contract with the
county hospitals. To share in the deal, Medrano recruited Gustavo
Buenrostro. In turn, Buenrostro contacted his friend James Barta,
the owner of Sav–Rx, which provides prescription benefit management
services. Barta was asked to pay a “finder’s fee” to Castro. He did
not pay, even after frequent e-mails and calls with deadlines and
ultimatums delivered over a period of months. Eventually, Barta
wrote Castro a Sav–Rx check for $6,500, saying that it was to help
his friend Buenrostro. Castro was an FBI agent, and the county
official and contract were fictional. Barta was charged with
conspiracy to commit bribery. At trial, the government conceded
that Barta was not predisposed to commit the crime. Could he be
absolved of the charge on a defense of entrapment? Explain.</p>

                                        <p>James Barta could be absolved of the charge on a defense
entrapment. Medrano had teamed up with Buenrostro to include James
Barta into the discussion before entering into the second deal
after the first being without the help of the latter two parties
but with the assistance of Castro in the scenario.&nbsp; Although
Buenrostro was aware of the bribery, James Barta was oblivion to
the fact that his prescription benefit management services Company
got this contract after Medrano and Buenrostro dealt with Castro
and the anonymous corrupt official in this regard.&nbsp; For this,
Medrano especially partnered with Buenrostro to grab the deal via
the route of bribery.&nbsp; Here, although Barta signed the check
of $6,500 which apparently partly consisted of the bribery amount
as told by Castro and the Official agent to Medrano and to
Buenrostro, the fact was that unknown by Barta and before the final
deal could take place, all the three parties, Medrano, Buenrostro
and Barta were arrested.&nbsp; However, based on the evidences, it
is obvious that Barta was unnecessary driven to the conspiracy and
the same could be backed by the testimonials of the FBI agent,
Castro in this regard.</p>
