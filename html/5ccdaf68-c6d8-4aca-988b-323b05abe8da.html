                                        <p>a) Present Value concept depends on the concept of time value of
money. According to time value of money, money that is available
now (immediately) is worth more than the same money that is
available after a time. This is because, even if money is received
now and kept idle, it will earn interest. Present value is finding
the present worth of future moneys received calculated at a
specified rate of return. In the given situation, considering a
constant rate of return, for example, 4%, the present value of
receiving $10,000 after three years would be less than
receiving&nbsp;$10,000 after two years. Here too, the same logic
applies, the benefit of receiving money sooner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the example taken (4% return), PV of $10,000 at 2 years would
be 10,000 x 1/(1.04)^2 = $9,245.56, and 3 years would be 10,000
x&nbsp;1/(1.04)^3 = $8,889.96.</p>
<p>Therefore, the present value of this gift (b)
<strong>increases.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
