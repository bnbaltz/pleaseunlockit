<li>How did Starbucks create its uniqueness in the first place? Why
was the uniqueness so successful?</li>
<li>To be a source of competitive advantage over time, core
competencies need to be continuously honed and upgraded. Why and
how did starbucks lose its uniqueness and struggle in the
mid-2000s? What strategic initiatives did Howard Schultz, following
his return as a CEO in 2008, put in place to re-create Starbucks'
uniqueness?</li>
<li>Howard Schultz, as the creator of the Starbucks brand that we
know today, is a larger than life figure in the company and
business community. Do you think it is difficult to follow such an
iconic leader? Why, or why not?</li>

                                        <p>Starbucks&#39; key focus from the outset was to create an environment for their clients so they could go and have a relaxed feeling to a spot away from work and home. Starbucks flourished when they provided a house away from home for their clients. They gave their visitors free Wi-Fi, coffee, music and relaxing with friends or by themselves. Starbucks had trouble enhancing its key competencies, which had impaired its consumer intake. They did not preserve their economic edge by preferring their store over a vast number of others. As Starbucks started opening stores every corner, its uniqueness was significantly affected.&nbsp;</p> <p>What began with coffee and a calming atmosphere became product sales that left their core skills and started to lose their distinctive culture. Starbucks should be re-established as a corporate effort. Shultz started with the hiring of the CEO and progressed through client experience to create demand for his brand. The first thing he did was shut all of Starbuck for a day so the barists had the opportunity to teach them the art of coffee making. I think that was an excellent idea because Starbucks still had a special feel for their coffee considering the fact that its coffee.</p> <p>The next plan was to upgrade the shops to give shoppers the experience of relaxing in a safe and spacious atmosphere. This was a major step for Shultz because it helps customers to prioritize their work without having to be frustrated with open clean areas. Shultz&#39;s next initiative was to avoid selling sandwiches for breakfast. The explanation was that he believed that the odor of breakfast food was the odor of coffee brewing in the morning. I don&#39;t believe it was a shopping good touch, but a deal breaker.&nbsp;A shop that brews coffee too much will scent enduring but I believe that Shultz was keen to make the most changes to ensure consumers appreciated the changes. Finally, the initiative of Shultz to re-create Starbucks uniqueness was taken to shut 600 U.S. shops. I assume this is the biggest effort so far, since the major expansion is when Starbucks was robbed of its uniqueness. With the decision to shut several markets, Shultz then focused on the stores that the faithful customers carried.</p> <p style="text-align:center"><strong><span style="color:red">PLEASE LEAVE A LIKE, IT HELPS ME A LOT.
