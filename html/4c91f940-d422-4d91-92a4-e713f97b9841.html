                                        Firstly, note that the question asks to *approximate* the probability that X-bar lies between 1/2 and 2/3. This would indicate to me to consider the result from the Central Limit Theorem.<br /><br />Suppose that a random variable, X, comes from a distribution with mean &micro; and variance s&sup2;. Consider taking samples from the population and recording the mean of each sample, say X-bar(1), X-bar(2), etc. Plotting these values gives the sampling distribution of X-bar. According to the Central Limit Theorem, the sampling distribution of X-bar ? N(&micro;, s&sup2;/n) as the size of each sample, n, approaches infinity (the number of samples is assumed to be infinite).<br /><br />Excellent, we can use this result! Let X~uni(0, 1) where X is continuous. Then the mean of a continuous uniform random variable is 1/2 and the variance is 1/12 (I'll use this without proof - since you obviously know about moment generating functions, you should be able to get this result yourself anyway). Therefore, using the notation above, &micro; = 1/2, and s&sup2; = 1/12. If we have 12 random samples, then n = 12.<br /><br />By the CLT, the sampling distribution of X-bar ? N(&micro;, s&sup2;/n) as n ? infinity. Since n = 12 and not infinity, we can only approximate the distribution of X-bar. Therefore the sampling distribution of X-bar is approximately:<br /><br />N(&micro;, s&sup2;/n)<br />= N(1/2, (1/12)/12)<br />= N(1/2, 1/144)<br /><br />To find the probability that X-bar lies between 1/2 and 2/3, we just need to standardise this random variable. We do this by subtracting the mean and dividing by the variance.<br /><br />Let Z = (X-bar - &micro;) / (s&sup2;/n)<br />= (X-bar - 1/2) / (1/144)<br />= 144(X-bar - 1/2)<br /><br />This random variable, Z, is now a standard normal variable with mean 0 and variance 1. That's helpful because now all you have to do is manipulate the probability expression and look up a statistics table.<br /><br />P(1/2 &lt; X-bar &lt; 2/3)<br />= P{144(1/2 - 1/2) &lt; Z &lt; 144(2/3 - 1/2)}<br />= P{0 &lt; Z &lt; 24}<br />= 0.50000 using a standard normal stats table<br />
