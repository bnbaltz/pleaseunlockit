At the time, this way of thinking was the dominant <strong>paradigm</strong> for social scientists. A <strong>paradigm</strong> is an example, model or pattern, especially the most <strong>basic</strong> or central one.</p> <p><span style="color:#f1c40f">Paradigm shift:-</span></p> <p><span style="color:#f1c40f">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>A&nbsp;<strong>paradigm shift</strong>, a concept identified by the American physicist and philosopher&nbsp;Thomas Kuhn, is a fundamental change in the basic&nbsp;concepts&nbsp;and&nbsp;experimental&nbsp;practices of a&nbsp;scientific discipline. Even though Kuhn restricted the use of the term to the natural sciences, the concept of a paradigm shift has also been used in numerous non-scientific contexts to describe a profound change in a fundamental model or perception of events.</p> <p>Kuhn presented his notion of a paradigm shift in his influential book&nbsp;<em>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</em>&nbsp;(1962).</p> <p>Kuhn contrasts paradigm shifts, which characterize a&nbsp;scientific revolution, to the activity of&nbsp;normal science, which he describes as scientific work done within a prevailing framework or&nbsp;paradigm. Paradigm shifts arise when the dominant paradigm under which normal science operates is rendered incompatible with new phenomena, facilitating the adoption of a new theory or paradigm.</p> <p>Paradigm shifts often happen when new technology is introduced that radically alters the production process or&nbsp;manufacturing&nbsp;of a good or service. These shifts are key drivers in many of the processes that a society undergoes such as the&nbsp;American Industrial Revolution.</p> <ul> 	<li>A paradigm shift is a major change in the concepts and practices of how something works or is accomplished.</li> 	<li>A paradigm shift very often happens when new technology is introduced that radically alters the production process of a good or service.</li> </ul> <p><span style="color:#f1c40f">Example:-</span></p> <p><span style="color:#f1c40f">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;The scientific method itself is a <strong>paradigm</strong> (though &quot;science&quot; views the world: a traditional Western, empirical, quantitative approach to studying things).</p> <p>Another&nbsp;<strong>example</strong>&nbsp;of a&nbsp;<strong>paradigm</strong>&nbsp;is the theory of evolution. Evolution is the underlying structure that best fits the observable evidence in fields as diverse as biology (the evolution of species), geology (the evolution of the earth), and cosmology (the evolution of the stars, the galaxies, and the universe).</p> <p><span style="color:#f1c40f">Plato&#39;s cave:-</span></p> <p><span style="color:#f1c40f">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<strong>Allegory of the Cave</strong>, or&nbsp;<strong>Plato&#39;s Cave</strong>, is an&nbsp;allegory&nbsp;presented by the&nbsp;Greek&nbsp;philosopher&nbsp;Plato&nbsp;in his work&nbsp;<em>Republic</em>&nbsp;(514a&ndash;520a) to compare &quot;the effect of&nbsp;education&nbsp;(&pi;&alpha;&iota;&delta;&epsilon;Î¯&alpha;) and the lack of it on our&nbsp;nature&quot;. It is written as a dialogue between Plato&#39;s brother&nbsp;Glaucon&nbsp;and his mentor&nbsp;Socrates, narrated by the latter.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the allegory, Socrates describes a group of people who have lived chained to the wall of a cave all their lives, facing a blank wall. The people watch shadows projected on the wall from objects passing in front of a fire behind them and give names to these shadows. The shadows are the prisoners&#39; reality but are not accurate representations of the real world. Three higher levels exist in the&nbsp;natural sciences;&nbsp;mathematics,&nbsp;geometry, and&nbsp;deductive logic; and the&nbsp;theory of forms.</p> <p>Socrates explains how the philosopher is like a prisoner who is freed from the cave and comes to understand that the shadows on the wall are not reality at all. A philosopher aims to understand and perceive higher levels of reality. However, the other inmates of the cave do not even desire to leave their prison, for they know no better life.</p>
