                                    <p>In Labrador retrievers coat color is controlled by two
independently assorting loci. The B locus controls hair color;
black (B) is dominant to chocolate (b). A second locus, E, allows
for deposition of the color on the hairs. The homozygous recessive
condition at this locus (ee) produces a yellow dog, regardless of
whether the animal is BB, Bb, or bb. You discover that your female
yellow Labrador is pregnant, and she delivers a litter of 5 black
puppies, 2 chocolate puppies and 3 yellow puppies.</p>
<p>(a) Is the father of the puppies the yellow Labrador from next
door or the black Labrador from down the street? How do you
know?</p>
<p>(b) What is the genotype of the father?</p>
<p>(c) What is the genotype of the mother?</p>
<p>(d) What is the genotype of the chocolate puppies?</p>
<p>(e) You also have a chocolate Labrador female that comes from a
pedigreed family of entirely chocolate Labradors. You mate her to a
yellow Labrador male that came from a family of 14 black Labrador
and 5 yellow Labrador brothers and sisters. The pedigree for the
family of the male only contains black and yellow Labradors going
back several generations. What is/are the expected phenotype(s) and
genotype(s) of the offspring of this mating and in what
proportions?&nbsp;</p>

                                        <p>Answer: At first we should understand about the genes. Both the
genes are independently assorting durnig segregation. But one gene
at loci E is regulating the phenotype of Loci B, so this is an
epistatic condition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the genes are independently assorting so we can make a table
of all possible combination of the alleles of these genes.</p>

<p>A) By the table we have all the possible genotype for the three
different phenotype. As the Female is Yellow so the possible
genotype for her&nbsp; loci E can be ; ee. And Possible gametes
from her will be ; e . As she has a yellow puppy so one allele mus
come from father to make it "ee". Possible genetype of father for
Loci E is Ee/ee</p>
<p>Now she delivers baby with colors Black, choclate, yellow. Black
is dominant so its single allele is enough. But she also produces
Choclate puppy for that the condition should be homozygous (bb). So
she must contribute allele b. For Loci B for mother can be : Bb.
Same applies to the father. Both mother and father must be having
atleast one recessive allele b. Possible genotype at Loci B for
father can be "Bb"only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;If it has ee than it has yellow color but if it has Ee it
can have either Black or choclate color. As both theYellow and the
Black Labrador can contribute allele "e". So both of them can be
father.</p>
<p>b) Possible genotype of father Black labrador
<strong>BbEe</strong> and for Yellowlabrador it is
<strong>Bbee</strong>.</p>
<p>c) Possible genotype of mother is <strong>Bbee.</strong></p>
<p>d) Choclate Puppies genotype can be <strong>bbEe</strong>.</p>
