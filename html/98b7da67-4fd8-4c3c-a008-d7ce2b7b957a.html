                                        <p>When there is a rise in the production of goods and services in an economy over a period of time, then it is termed as economic growth.</p> <p>The factors that help and support the economy in increasing its production of goods and services are said to promote economic growth.</p> <p>The factors that lead to a decrease in the production of goods and services in an economy are said to inhibit economic growth.</p> <p>The existance of laws that prevent theft will promote economic growth. This is because it will prevent the loss of goods and capital due to theft and hence lead to an increase the production of goods and services.</p> <p>Price controls imposed on milk will promote economic growth. Milk is used as a raw material for the production of various products. If there is no price check on milk and its price increases substantially then it would lead to reduction in&nbsp;the production of those milk based products. Therefore, price control on milk is necessary for economic growth.</p> <p>Laws preventing industrial espionage&nbsp; promotes economic growth. If there is a healthy competion in economy and competitors are not hampering each others growth then this will to an increase in the production of goodd and services and therefore&nbsp; lead to economic growth.</p> <p>The use of competitive markets to allocate goods and services promotes economic growth. Competitive markets create a pressure on the firms to increase their efficiency. This will lead to an increase in the production of goods and services in the economy and hence promote economic growth.</p> <p>Capital gains taxed at 90% will inhibit economic growth. Huge taxes will increase the costs of production and lead to a decrease in supply of goods and services. Therefore, it will inhibit economic growth.</p> <p>A corrupt government will inhibit economic growth. A corrupt government will not be supportive of the industries and the industries may not take decisions in the favor of economy. It may ask for bribe from time to time leading a wastage of resources of industries. Hence, this will inhibit ecoomic growth.</p> <p>A nation&#39;s central bank declares it will print money to pay for government expenditure will inhibit economic growth. It will lead to hyperinflaton if the central bank takes this step and hence this will inhibit economic growth.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>
