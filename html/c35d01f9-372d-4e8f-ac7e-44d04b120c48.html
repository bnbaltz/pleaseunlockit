                                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A person has traditionally been obese if they are more than 20%
over their ideal weight. The ideal weight of a person can be
calculated based on his/her height, age and sex. National Institute
of Health (NIH) defined obesity as a BMI (body mass index). Since
the BMI describes the body weight relative to height, it correlates
to the total fat content of the body.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Factors contribute to obesity are as follows:</strong>
<strong><strong>Life style choices (lack of
exercise)</strong></strong><strong>Medical conditions
(hypothyroidism)</strong><strong>Genetical inheritance
(heredity)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Set point theory explains how the metabolism of humans
adjusts to keep the ideal body weight constant. Body weight and fat
content of the body are the two determining factors in human
beings.Based on these factors the body metabolism is regulated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The life of a living organisms had been maintained by different
bio chemical reactions takes place in the body. These biochemical
reactions include catabolism and anabolism. These two reactions are
together constituting metabolism. Food is measured in calories
which the body processes as energy. The extra energy produced by
the metabolism is stored in the form of fat, some of the energy is
utilized during exercises or physical activities of the body.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Muscles are very active parts of the human body. Muscles require
a lot of energy to maintain. Janine said that increasing muscle
mass increases metabolism. She is right because the muscle activity
is increased by increase in metabolism. The extra energy which is
stored in the form of energy is utilized for the formation of
muscle tissues. As stated above more energy is used for the
maintenance of healthy muscles. Hence, the more muscle mass you
have the more energy you need to sustain it. This consequently
increases metabolism and burns fat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The production of urine by the kidney is increased by diuretic
conditions. This is commonly called water pills. This process helps
to excrete unwanted toxic substances from the body. Getting rid of
excess salt and fluid helps lower blood pressure and can make it
easier for heart to pump. The fluid balance is stabilized by the
process called homeostasis. Diuretic affects homeostasis of the
fluid because it enhances the release of the urine that is in the
kidney, hence excess amount of water and waste are liberated
out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Toxins are unwanted poisonous substances present in the body
that can cause various diseases to human beings. These toxic
substances are eliminated from the body by the process called
detoxification. Body eliminates these toxic substances through
skin, kidneys, lymph and intestine. The toxic substances are
existing in the form of proteins, molecules or peptides. The
deposition of these poisonous chemical substances causes the weight
loss. To overcome this problem these toxic chemical substances are
eliminated by diluting them by using extra water and other safety
methods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mitchel has body image problem. Mitchel looking fatty when
compare to others. Even though he already looks good, Mitchel feels
that he must lose more weight to look better. Body image problem
can result in further health problems including anorexia and
bulimia.</p>
