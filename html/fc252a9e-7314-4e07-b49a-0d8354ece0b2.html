                                        <p>Political - As per rules of China, foreign investors directly
cannot invest in Alibaba. They need to go through a shell company
to invest. This is a loophole to get around the foreign investment
rules.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chinese government can anytime close this loophole which
will mean foreign investors will no longer be able to invest in
Alibaba which will mean liquidity crunch for the company</p>
<p>Economic - Major macro enomic reforms were being implemented by
the government but at the same time foreign investors and companies
were being restricted to establish e-commerce and other set up in
China</p>
<p>Due to these reforms, overall growth rate of economy fell which
led to fall in e-commerce growth rate as well.</p>
<p>Social - Due to aging population and restrictive child policy,
labour had become an issue as able bodied men were not available
for easy employment and hecne, had started building pressure on
companies depending on labor</p>
<p>Technology - Smartphone sales had an explosive growth in the
recent years and had contributed to growth rate.</p>
<p>Ecosystem - Government was restrictive of high pollution
industries such as cement steel and coal which was the backbone of
the economy</p>
<p>Legal - A govt arm of the industry and commerce has taken some
special control in Alibaba due to a lot of counterfeit products
being sold on Alibaba</p>
<p>Opportunities - Govt was restrictive of foreign investors in
e-commerce and internet space which was an opportunity for Alibaba
to start some companies.</p>
<p>Threat - counterfeit products was a high threat for reputation
of Alibaba as well as a legal threat from govt.</p>
