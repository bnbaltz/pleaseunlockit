                                        <p>There is a legal theory on which a court might enforce Lisaâ€™s
promise and it is promissory estoppel. According to statute of
frauds, the contracts that involve transfer of an interest in land
should be in writing. But there are some exceptions to the writing
requirement which include admission, performance and promissory
estoppel. Here Lisa has promised to transfer half of the assets to
Peter after his divorce. Peter has relied on that promise and paid
the property taxes for the estate which resulted into his
detriment. According to promissory estoppel, such promises where
the promisee relies on the promise to his subsequent detriment are
legally binding and do not require to be in writing. Hence this is
case holds an exception for the writing requirement in statute of
frauds based on promissory estoppel.</p>
