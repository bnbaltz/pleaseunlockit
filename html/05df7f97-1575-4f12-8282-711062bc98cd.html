He abandoned personal hygiene because the compulsive rituals that he had to carry out during washing or cleaning were so time-consuming that he could do nothing else. Almost continual showering gave way to no showering. He stopped cutting and washing his hair and beard, brushing his teeth, and changing his clothes. He left his room infrequently and to avoid rituals associated with the toilet, defecated on paper towels, urinated in paper cups, and stored waste in the closet. He ate only late at night when his family was asleep. To be able to eat, he had to exhale completely, making a lot of hissing noises, coughs and hacks, and then fill his mouth with as much food as he could while there is no air in his lungs. He would eat only a mixture of peanut butter, sugar, cocoa, milk, and mayonnaise. All other foods he considered contaminants. When he walked, he took small steps on his toes while continually looking back, checking, and rechecking. Occasionally, he ran quickly in place. He withdrew his left arm completely from his shirt sleeve as if he were crippled and his shirt was a sling.</span></p></div>

His various behaviors were attempts to suppress sexual and aggressive thoughts or to avoid the devastating consequences of not practicing his rituals. James performed the repetitive behaviors and mental functions mentioned in the DSM-IV criteria. It can be forced behavior (hand washing or checking) or mental (thinking, counting, praying, etc. in a particular order about certain words) (Foa et al., 1996; Purdon, 2009; Steketee &amp; Barlow, 2002) The important thing is that they reduce stress or prevent a terrible event. Coercion is often &quot;magical&quot; because it do not make a logical connection with the occupation.</p>
