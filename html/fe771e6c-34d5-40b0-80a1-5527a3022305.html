                                    <p>This is a summary of a research experiment that was published in
the following article:<br>
Beadle, G. and Tatum, E. 1941. Genetic control of biochemical
reactions in&nbsp;<em>Neurospora</em>, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 27:
499-506.</p>
<p>Early studies in biochemistry and medicine identified human
genetic diseases caused by enzymes that are either missing or are
defective in the affected individual.&nbsp; Researchers also
recognized that there is a genetic component to these diseases,
because family members of patients with these types of diseases are
more likely to contract the disease than if they didn’t have an
affected family member.&nbsp; This information led scientists to
believe that there may be a connection between genes and
enzymes.&nbsp; A classic genetic research study was performed in an
attempt to find evidence for this idea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1941, George Beadle and Edward Tatum, working at Stanford
University, conducted a study of mutant strains of a fungus (Beadle
and Tatum, 1941).&nbsp; The fungus they used was a common bread
mold called&nbsp;<em>Neurospora crassa</em>.&nbsp; They created
these mutant strains by exposing yeast spores to X-rays which can
damage DNA.&nbsp; The mutant strains
of&nbsp;<em>Neurospora</em>&nbsp;were then screened to identify any
mutants that were unable to produce the amino acid arginine.&nbsp;
The biochemical pathway for the production of arginine is shown in
Figure 1.&nbsp; Each step of the pathway is catalyzed by a
different enzyme (Enz E through Enz H) indicated above the arrow
for each step of the pathway.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Beadle and Tatum proposed that different mutations in
the&nbsp;<em>Neurospora</em>&nbsp;strains would block different
steps in the biochemical pathway by disabling the enzyme required
for that step.&nbsp; The experimental method they used was to first
identify mutant strains that were unable to grow unless arginine
was supplied to them in the growth medium.&nbsp; Four different
mutant strains were isolated.&nbsp; They then transferred these
yeast strains to growth media containing nutritional supplements
other than arginine to determine if any other supplement was
sufficient to allow the mutant strain to grow.&nbsp; The other
supplements they tested were the intermediates of the biochemical
pathway for arginine synthesis.&nbsp; Specifically, they tested the
ability of the&nbsp;<em>Neurospora</em>&nbsp;arginine mutants to
grow when they were supplied with ornithine, citruline, and
argininosuccinate.&nbsp; The results of these growth studies are
shown in Figure 2.</p>
<p></p>
<p>These results allowed Beadle and Tatum to identify which enzyme
of the arginine biosynthetic pathway was defective in each of the
four arginine mutants.&nbsp; From this work, Beadle and Tatum
proposed the “one gene-one enzyme” hypothesis that we now call the
“one gene-one polypeptide” hypothesis.&nbsp; In 1958, Beadle and
Tatum received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beadle and Tatum hypothesized that</p>
<p>Group of answer choices (pick one)</p>
<p>1. a mutation in a gene leads to the loss of function of a
specific enzyme</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; mutant strains of Neurospora would not grow without
arginine in the medium</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; DNA mutations result from defective enzymes in the
arginine biosyhthesis pathway</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; X-rays are capable of damaging DNA</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hypothesis of the experiment allowed Beadle and Tatum to
predict that</p>
<p>Group of answer choices (pick one)</p>
<p>1. growth of the mutants would be dependent on factors other
than the supplements</p>
<p>2. a different supplement would be needed for the growth of each
mutant strain</p>
<p>3. each mutant strain is the result of a different change in the
DNA</p>
<p>4. supplementing the growth media with ornithine would allow all
mutant strains to grow</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The independent variable of this experiment was</p>
<p>Group of answer choices (pick one)</p>
<p>1. the nutritional supplements included in the growth medium</p>
<p>2. the use of X-rays to induce mutations in the DNA</p>
<p>3. the amount of growth of the mutant strain in each growth
medium</p>
<p>4. the amount of arginine produced by the mutant strain</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beadle and Tatum concluded that</p>
<p>Group of answer choices (pick one)</p>
<p>1. all Neurospora strains require the addition of a nutritional
supplement in the medium</p>
<p>2. only Neurospora mutant strains require nutritional
supplements in the growth medium</p>
<p>3. enzymes only function properly when the correct nutritional
supplement is present</p>
<p>4. each gene codes for the production of a specific enzyme</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While conducting this experiment, Beadle and Tatum assumed
that</p>
<p>Group of answer choices (pick one)</p>
<p>1. each mutant strain possessed only one mutation (only 1 change
in its DNA)</p>
<p>2. inducing mutations with X-rays would produce mutations only
in genes for enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway for arginine</p>
<p>3. mutant #2 possessed a mutation in the gene that encodes Enz
G</p>
<p>4. additional mutations to the Neurospora strains would repair
the original mutations</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The conclusion of this experiment implies that</p>
<p>Group of answer choices (pick one)</p>
<p>1. Neurospora is a good organism for genetic studies</p>
<p>2. human diseases caused by defective enzymes are the result of
mutations in specific genes</p>
<p>3. the addition of a nutritional supplement fixes the defect in
the enzyme</p>
<p>4. providing nutritional supplements to mutants will correct for
any mutation</p>
