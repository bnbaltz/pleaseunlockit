                                    <p>A. Suppose the Canadian exchange rate E (in terms of US$) is
C$1.33 and the face values and the prices of the one-year
government bonds in Canada and the United States are as follows.
Canada: Face Value = C$12,000 and Price = C$11,650.49 United
States: Face Value = US$10,000 and Price = US$9615.38 Compute the
nominal interest rate on the one-year Canadian and US bonds and the
expected exchange rate next year consistent with uncovered interest
parity.</p>
<p>B. Compute the marginal propensity to consume (for both domestic
goods and foreign goods) and marginal propensity to save if the
consumption function is C=1.5 + 0.8(YT) and the trade balance is TB
= 5(1-[1/E]) â€“ 0.2(Y-8).</p>
<p>C. The investment function is I= 3-10i. What is the investment
when the interest rate is equal to 10% or 0.10? Assume government
spending is given by G. Write down an expression for Aggregate
Demand (D).</p>
<p>D. Assume that the forex market equilibrium is given by: i =
([1/E]-1) + 0.10, where the two foreign returns in the right-hand
side are the expected depreciation, and the foreign interest rate.
What is the foreign interest rate? What is the expected future
exchange rate?</p>
<p>E. Finally, solve for the IS curve: using the above equations
obtain an expression for Y in terms of i, G and T (eliminate
E).</p>
