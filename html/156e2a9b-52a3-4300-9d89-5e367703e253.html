<p>Socrates argued that evil is done out of ignorance.&nbsp; What
do you think that Socrates meant by this? Do you agree with his
view or do you think that people can act against their best
interests and with knowledge?&nbsp; Are there any examples of human
behavior that you think correspond to what Socrates means? Any
counter-examples?&nbsp;Do any of the narratives tap into the theme
of how ignorance can impact us in such a way?</p>

                                        <p>Socrates was a genius but he never wanted to be called a genius. According to him, we should question everything around us to know the reality. He believed that only those people who think they know nothing are intelligent. Socrates&nbsp;claimed that evil is done out of ignorance and not from the intention to do evil. This view appears debatable to many as they think that many people do evil things out of self interests or sometime act on impulse. However, if we look closely and understand the psyche of a person, we understand that what a person does at any point of time is out of self interest or either not knowing what will benefit them the most or not knowing the correct method of attaining their self interests. According to him, a person always do what he finds the best out of all possibilities for his self interests. Rigth and wrong are two faces of the same coin. For e.g. a person stealing money from other person because he doesn&#39;t have enough money to buy things that he want. Another example of a person donating money to charity and by helping people he feels good and perceives the pleasure. In both these cases, the person work out of his self interest.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is 100% true because if a person finds a better alternative than the one causing harm to other, he will chose the alterantive way of solving things. An&nbsp;alcoholic who knows that alcohol is dangerous to health still drinks it. The alcoholic is&nbsp;aware of the situation but still denies to avoid it. Is he working against his self interest? In this case, if we understand the psyche of this person, we will understand that even after knowing his self interests, he can not resist it. This is out of ignorance because he doesn&#39;t work on any other alternative. An alocholic person out of pain or passion finds it difficult to avoid it. Ignorance is harmful for us and for the whole world too. Carl jung also talked about&nbsp;the evil forces within humans. He mentioned in his articles that we need to find the shadow and fight it else it will become a dark world without light, energy and compassion.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>
