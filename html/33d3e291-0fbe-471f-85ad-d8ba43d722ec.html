                                    <p>Part IV â€“ Deicing Disrupts the Environment and Osmoregulation in
Amphibians Questions 1. Many scientific studies examining the
relationship between increased salinity in freshwater habitats and
species richness of amphibians only collect data for one or maybe
two years. How might this lead to inaccurate conclusions about the
problems caused by the application of deicing agents?</p>
<p>2. It was generally thought that salinity increases in
freshwater habitats during early spring months and declines over
the rest of the year, but recent studies indicate this might not be
the case. In fact, salinity levels may actually increase during the
summer months even though no deicing agents are actively applied.
Why?</p>
<p>However, actual salinities differ during the tidal cycle.
Salinity rates in estuaries usually decrease in spring as snowmelt
and rain increase the supply of freshwater from lakes and
groundwater. Salinity levels typically rise during the summer as
elevated temperatures accelerate the evaporation of the
estuary.</p>
<p>3. Considering what you just saw in the video, take a moment to
hypothesize how the following renal system adaptations could
actually compound the problems amphibians encounter if salinity
levels increased to 1000 mOsm: a. Adaptation: body fluid
concentration of approximately 250 mOsm. b. Adaptation: high
glomerular filtration rate. c. Adaptation: diminished loop of
Henle. d. Adaptation: production of ammonia from protein
catabolism.</p>

                                        <p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Answer 1: </strong>Deicing is primarily done using salts like sodium chloride (NaCl). These salts run off to the fresh water ecosystems and disrupts the osmoregulation of amphibians. The scientific study to examine the relationship between increased salinity in fresh water habitat and species richness of amphibians show the effect of increased salinity on species.<strong> </strong>However, since the data is for one to two years, the sampling is not conclusive for the increased salinity of fresh water due to deicing.</p> <p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Answer 2:</strong> The salinity levels may increase during the summer months even though no deicing agents are actively applied because, some amount of salts has already accumulated in the fresh water. In summer when the water is evaporated in maximum, the proportion of salt content in the fresh water increases relative to the water content. &nbsp;</p> <p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Answer 3: </strong>There are different renal system adaptation in amphibians to encounter high saline levels. Body fluid concentration regulate the capacity to withstand osmotic stress. The glomerular filtration should be high. &nbsp;</p>
