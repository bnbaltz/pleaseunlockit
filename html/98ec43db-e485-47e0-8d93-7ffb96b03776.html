                                        <p><strong>Dear student ,</strong></p> <ul> 	<li><strong><u>FIRST GENERATION GLUCOSE;</u></strong></li> </ul> <p><br /> &mdash;The concept of glucose measurement biosensor was first proposed in 1962 by Clark and Lyons from Cincinnati Children&#39;s Hospital. The first glucose biosensor is made up of an oxygen electrode, an insufficient inner layer of oxygen, a thin layer of GOx, and an outer layer of dialysis. Enzymes may not work on an electrochemical detector to form an enzyme electrode. The decrease in the average oxygen concentration was equivalent to the concentration of glucose.</p> <p>The first commercially successful glucose biosensor using Clark technology was the Yellow Springs Instrument Company&#39;s (Model 23A YSI analyzer) direct measurement of sugar in 1975, which was based on the detection of amperometric hydrogen peroxide. This analysis was almost exclusively used in clinical laboratories due to its high cost due to its expensive platinum electrode.<br /> First-generation biosensors are based on the use of natural oxygen and the availability of hydrogen peroxide produced. However, a major problem with the first generation of glucose biosensors is that the amperometric ratio of hydrogen peroxide requires high performance which may have high selectivity.</p> <ul> 	<li><strong><u>SECOND GENERATION OF GLUCOSE ;</u></strong></li> </ul> <p><br /> &mdash;The above mentioned&nbsp;limitations of first-generation glucose biosensors were overcome using mediated glucose biosensors, i.e., second-generation glucose sensors. Improvement has been achieved by removing oxygen and installing non-physical electron receptors, called redox mediators that can carry electrons from the enzyme to the surface of the active electrode. The reduced mediator is formed instead of hydrogen peroxide and then reconstituted on the electrode, providing an amperometric signal and restoring the oxidized form of the mediator. Various types of electron mediators, such as ferrocene, ferricyanide, quinines, thionine, methylene blue, and methyl viologen have been used to enhance sensory function. Ferrocenes are equivalent to all good mediator mechanisms, such as oxygen-resistant, stable in both composite and reduced forms, independent of pH, reflecting the kinetics of the electron shifting electron, and reacting rapidly with the enzyme. mediators between GOx and GDH-PQQ and electrodes.</p> <ul> 	<li><strong><u>THIRD GENERATION OF GLUCOSE ;</u></strong></li> </ul> <p><br /> &mdash;Third-generation biosensors are reagentless and are based on direct transfer between the enzyme and the electrode without regulators. Instead of highly toxic mediators, the electrode can perform direct electron transfer using biological conduction-based transfer mechanisms. Thus, third-generation biosensors have led to implantation, of needle-type devices that continue to monitor blood vivo. Activating organic salts, such as tetrathiafulvalene-tetracyanoquinodimethane (TTF-TCNQ), is known to mediate the electrochemistry of the enzyme pyrrole-quinolinequinone (GDH-PQQ) and flavoprotein (GOx). And the absence of intermediaries gives biosensors a higher choice.</p> <p>(The major difference between these generations are told above in between paragraphs)</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>PLEASE DO AN UPVOTE :))</strong></p>
