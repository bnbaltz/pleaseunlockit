                                        <p>The industry sectors like hospitals have become increasingly
professionalized, along with increased expectations on a CEO. In
this context, the demands a CEO faces are multifaceted. For a
successful CEO/Board relationship, they must be mutually sensitive
to each other in taking up the responsibilities. In a profitable
relationship, the strong partnership between the Chair of the Board
and the CEO is a crucial element. Such a relationship will enable
the organization to execute its strategy more effectively,
successfully navigate a crisis and resolve any other multitude of
issues that they encounter to achieve the purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Key Components CEO/Board
relationship</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Accountability</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CEO is accountable to the Board and the way in which these
accountability roles are executed is crucial. The CEO should
effectively report to the Board and keep it well informed of the
functions of the organization. The balancing act of determining how
much detail is given when reporting lies on the CEO. The consistent
communication and cooperation in order to meet the ultimate
accountability are essential.</p>
<p><strong>Decision Making</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CEO is responsible for practically implementing the vision,
mission, goal and policies, designed or created by the Board, and
then reporting on operational outcomes. The CEO must make sure that
everyone in the organization is aware of the agreed strategic
direction, goals and policies in order to ensure everyone is
heading in the same direction.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Policies</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CEO will provide policy suggestions for the Board’s
consideration monitoring these organizational policies is the CEO’s
responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Reports</strong>&nbsp;</p>

Board for review and approval is prepared by the CEO. The CEO will
suggest ideas and strategies on how performance can be improved.

presented by the CEO and all appropriate information will be
gathered. The ultimate responsibility for the financial health of
the organization is on the Board and which can be achieved with the
cooperation of the CEO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The relationship with the Board and CEO is complex and tense
many a times. A healthy and professional relationship is crucial to
the success of the organization.&nbsp;Both must work together to
achieve the common organizational purpose. The ability of the
organization to effectively respond to change will be hindered by
the perceived ambivalence. For effective functioning of the
&nbsp;CEO, she/he must be confident that decisions made will be
supported by the Board. Effective communication from CEO, prompt
response to reasonable requests for information will enhance the
cooperation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The oneness of a team must work for better obligation regardless
of the size and type of the organization. The principles of
teamwork like mutual respect, an understanding of one’s own
contribution, an awareness and reasonable degree of tolerance of
each other’s weaknesses and constraints and a sense of common
purpose will strengthen the relationship. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
