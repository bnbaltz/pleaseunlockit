<p>**Consider that when we excersie we burn glucose and also lose
mass. Why does this happen?</p>
<p>1.Our cells use up the potential energy stored in glucose, and
losing that energy during exercise reduces our mass</p>
<p>2.Our cells convert the mass in glucose into energy, which it
weightless.</p>
<p>3.Our cells convert the mass in glucose into energy that is used
durinf excersice.Losing that energy reduces our mass.</p>
<p>4.Our cells convert glucose into CO2 and water, which are
eliminated from our bodies when we excersice.</p>

                                        <p>2.Reducing the number of protons required by ATP synthase to
produce an ATP molecule</p>
<p>4H+ ions are required for the synthesis of one molecule
of&nbsp;ATP. If somehow the proton number is decreased, probably
the number of ATP synthesized could be more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the electrons travel through the chain, they go from a higher
to a lower energy level, moving from less electron-hungry to more
electron-hungry molecules. Energy is released in these “downhill”
electron transfers, and several of the protein complexes use the
released energy to pump protons from the mitochondrial matrix to
the intermembrane space, forming a proton gradient.&nbsp;The
transport chain builds a proton gradient across the inner
mitochondrial membrane, with a higher concentration of H+&nbsp;in
the intermembrane space and a lower concentration in the matrix.
This gradient represents a stored form of energy, and, as we’ll
see, it can be used to make ATP.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Our cells convert the mass in glucose into energy that
is used during exercise. Losing that energy reduces our mass.</p>
<p>glycolysis is the process in which glucose is converted to the
product which is further metabolized to produce energy and when
this energy is used up glucose stores or the energy stores get
emptied out and we lose mass.</p>
