                                    Carnack contracts to sell his house and lot to Willard for $100,000. The terms of the contract call for Willard to pay 10% of the purchase price as a deposit toward the purchase price, or as a down payment. The terms further stipulate that should the buyer breach the contract, Carnack will retain the deposit as liquidated damages. Willard pays the deposit, but because her expected financing of the $90,000 balance falls through, she breaches the contract. Two weeks later, Carnack sells the house and lot to Balkova for $105,000. Willard demands her $10,000 back, but Carnack refuses, claiming that Willard

                                        <p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;">The term liquidated damages simply means a set amount of money that has been specified in the contract to be paid in the event of a breach by a particular party (Miller &amp; Jentz, 2010). In our scenario, Willard breaches a real estate contract with Carnack to purchase a home, after paying $10,000 or 10% down. The liquidated damages provision of this contract specifies that this amount will be forfeit if Willard breaches the contract. Unfortunately for Carnack, this liquidated damages clause is unenforceable Here's why.</p><p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"></p><p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"><br></p><p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;">In order for a liquidated damages clause to be enforceable it must be deemed by the court to not cross the line into punitive damages territory. Punitive damages are designed to punish a party for breaching a contract are not enforceable (Miller &amp; Jentz, 2010). In order for a liquidated damages clause to remain enforceable it must meet two criteria: was the amount that was pre-determined reasonable and not excessive, and when the contract was made, would it have been difficult to gauge what the damages might be in the event of a breach (Miller &amp; Jentz, 2010)? If the answer to either question is no, than a court would likely find the clause unenforceable</p><p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"></p><p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"><br></p><p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;">In the case of Willard v. Carnack the contract doesn't really stand up to either test. The amount of $10,000 is extremely excessive as damages when Carnack was able to sell the property in short order for even more than he had contract with Willard to sell it. Also, it would have been fairly easy to determine the amount of damages caused by Willard's breach at the time of the breach. Carnack would have had to simply put the property back on the market and sell it to determine the difference in price of his contract with Willard and a new contract. In this case, Willard did indeed breach the contract, so the courts might award damages. However, considering that the breach actually left Carnack better off, the damages would only likely be nominal.</p><p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"></p><p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"><br></p><p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"><br></p><p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"></p><p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;">References:</p><p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"><br></p><p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"></p><p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;">Miller, R.
