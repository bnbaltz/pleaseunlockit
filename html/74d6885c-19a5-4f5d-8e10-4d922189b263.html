                                        <p><strong><u>Ans : </u>The definition and the differentiation between Functional Areas and Business units are given below :</strong></p> <p><strong><u>Functional Areas Of Amazon</u></strong></p> <p>An organizational structure which establishes the design and system of interactions among members of the firm. For e.g , Amazon&rsquo;s corporate structure determines how managers direct and influence operational activities in various business areas.</p> <p>The Amazon.com has a functional organizational structure. The following characteristics are the most significant in Amazon&rsquo;s corporate structure:</p> <p>i) Global function-based groups<br /> ii) Global hierarchy<br /> iii) Geographic divisions</p> <p><strong><u>The Global Function-Based Groups :</u></strong> These Function based groups are the most significant characteristic of Amazon&rsquo;s organizational structure. And each business function has a team along with a senior manager. The following are the major function based groups in Amazon&rsquo;s organizational structure:</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Office of the CEO<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Business Development<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; c)&nbsp; Amazon Web Services<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Finance<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e) International Consumer Business<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f) Accounting<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; g) Consumer Business<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; h) Legal and Secretariat</p> <p><strong><u>Global Hierarchy : </u></strong>The Global hierarchy is a traditional structural characteristic. Amazon&#39;s such characteristic is expressed in terms of a global system of vertical lines of command and authority that influence the online retail firm. Thus, the main strategic objective of the corporate structure is to facilitate managerial control of Amazon&rsquo;s entire organization.</p> <p><strong><u>The Geographic Divisions :</u></strong> In Amazon&rsquo;s geographic divisions groups are&nbsp; based on geographic regions and related business goals. For e.g , Amazon.com uses geographic divisions to make it easier to manage the e commerce business based on economic conditions of certain regions. And the main strategic objective in having this is to enable the company to address issues relevant to each geographic region considering the differences among regional markets. Thus , Amazon has a simple approach involving the following geographic divisions in its operations: North America and International.</p> <p><strong><u>Business Units </u></strong></p> <p>Amazon&#39;s business is made up of five primary divisions i.e Amazon.com, AWS, Alexa, Whole Foods Market and Prime. Each of Amazon&#39;s five primary divisions would on its own be an impressive business.</p> <p>i) In the last five years, the revenue of Amazon increased by 183% from $136 billion in 2016 to a whopping $386 Billion in 2020.</p> <p>ii)&nbsp;AWS offers its products and services to consumers, sellers, as well as developers, enterprises and content creators.</p> <p>iii) Alexa is designed to replace everything. The goal of the product is seamlessly purchasing everything. One-click checkout isn&rsquo;t enough anymore.The beauty of Alexa (for Amazon) is selection. While customers who shop on Amazon.com currently have access to a wide variety of brands, ultimately Alexa helps in choosing this.</p> <p>iv) The Whole Foods acquisition allows Amazon to leverage existing demand and largely decrease supply risk while offering edible options to online customers.</p> <p>v) The Prime is both a free two-day shipping service and streaming for content and entertainment. It is estimated that 63 million US homes have Prime (up 35% year to date). And ultimately, Amazon just wants to increase Prime subscribers. This is the perfect flywheel connector.</p> <p>The AWS and Prime are more profitable among them.</p> <p><strong>The Analysis by functional areas and Business Units in achieving strategic and operational goals is that if the company wants to make Alliance , Product and market development and diversification than strategic planning process is required on the part of a company&rsquo;s upper-level management. </strong>In the end, a company&rsquo;s management will settle on a strategy that is most likely to produce positive results (usually defined as improving the company&rsquo;s bottom line) and that can be executed in a cost efficient manner with a high likelihood of success while avoiding undue financial risk.</p> <p>The development and execution of strategic planning are typically viewed as consisting of being performed in three critical steps:</p> <p>a) Strategy Formulation :</p> <p>In the process of formulating a strategy, a company will first assess its current situation by performing an internal and external audit. And its purpose of this is to help identify the organization&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses, as well as opportunities and threats (SWOT Analysis). As a result of the analysis, managers decide on which plans or markets they should focus on or abandon, how to best allocate the company&rsquo;s resources, and whether to take actions such as expanding operations through a joint venture or merger.</p> <p>Business strategies have long-term effects on organizational success. Only upper management executives are usually authorized to assign the resources necessary for their implementation.</p> <p>b) Strategy Implementation :</p> <p>After a strategy is formulated, the company needs to establish specific goals related to putting the strategy into action and allocate resources for the strategy&rsquo;s execution. The success of the implementation stage is often determined by how good a job upper management does in regard to clearly communicating the chosen strategy throughout the company .The effective strategy implementation involves developing a solid structure for implementing the strategy, maximizing the utilization of relevant resources and redirecting marketing efforts in line with the strategy&rsquo;s goals and objectives.</p> <p>c) Strategy Evaluation :</p> <p>Strategy evaluation involves three crucial activities i.e reviewing the internal and external factors affecting the implementation of the strategy, measuring performance and taking corrective steps to make the strategy more effective.</p> <p>All three steps in strategic planning occur within three hierarchical levels: upper management, middle management and operational levels. Thus, it is imperative to foster communication and interaction among employees and managers at all levels so as to help the firm to operate as a more functional and effective team.</p> <p>The company&rsquo;s continuing success in expanding its business helps in achieving the strategic and operational goals and its&nbsp; an indicator of the suitability of this organizational structure. They are continually raising the bar of the customer experience by using the internet and technology to help consumers find, discover and buy anything and empower businesses and content creators to maximise their success in achieving their goals.</p> <p>An advantage of function-based groups and hierarchy is that they enable Amazon.com Inc. to rapidly and effectively implement managerial directives. And also, geographic divisions are advantageous in supporting focus on online retail market concerns and related economic conditions in certain regions such as North America. And to seamlessly link the digital and brick-and-mortar shopping experience in order to be part of every single purchase made.
