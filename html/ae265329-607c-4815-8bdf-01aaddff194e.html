Simultaneously, inflationary pressures are mounting on Chinese economy signaling that there is an internal imbalance too. Presence of high inflation along with current account surplus suggests a highly depreciated exchange rate of Chinese yuan with other currencies. And hence a high level of output and employment.</p> <p>Therefore Chinese economy should be located in Zone 1 with current account surplus and high employment. Point 1 exhibits the long run equilibrium level of exchange rate and domestic spending that is needed to maintain both internal and external balance. </p> <p>Currently, China is hovering around point 2. Since there is inflation and higher output, it implies there should be a higher level of domestic spending along with a depreciated exchange rate.</p> </div></div><div class="col"><div class="answer"> <p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/532/5322f42b-761b-4677-900d-1a3c36e88cf3/202680-19-9P-i1.png" /> </p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/96d/96dddc3f-f0c5-4773-b7b1-e345f1ec3afa/202680-19-9P-i2.png" /> </p> </p> </div></div><div class="col"><div class="answer"> <p>b)</p> <p>To bring Chinese economy back to the equilibrium level of exchange rate and domestic spending (point 1), where it is able to achieve its external balance (shown by <i>XX </i>schedule) and internal imbalance (shown by <i>II </i>schedule), only the combination of appreciation and domestic spending contraction can move the Chinese economy to internal and external balance.</p> <p>Chinese government can adopt contractionary fiscal policy. Simultaneously, Chinese central bank, that is, Peopleâ€™s bank of China must intervene in forex market to buy Chinese yuan so as to slow down its depreciation.</p> <p>Fiscal contraction alone can reduce domestic spending and thus bring internal balance but only at the cost of excessive current account surplus: a movement from point 2 to point 3 where domestic spending is reduced, but the exchange rate is unchanged.</p> <p>Similarly fiscal expansion can cause yuan appreciation, a movement from point 2 to point 4, but only at the cost of a much higher level of inflation.</p> <p> <p><img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/81f/81f25761-ab0b-4ab5-987f-b3c5028ed9c1/202680-19-9P-i3.png" /></p><p><img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/44f/44f2f7c6-87ff-47ff-9d2d-c14b22e6793f/202680-19-9P-i4.png" /></p></p> </div></div><div class="col"><div class="answer"> <p>Given the excessive current account surplus and lower level of government services, it is difficult for Chinese government to contract its expenditure. Chinese government would also like to bring workers from the rural areas to urban manufacturing sector and at the same time it is not willing to demotivate its urban employed workers. On the other side, eventually Chinese government needs to reduce its deficit otherwise inflationary pressures will keep on surging.</p> <p> <i>Therefore Chinese government must adopt a targeted or net fiscal contraction. On a broader level, it should increase the tax rates so that domestic spending is reduced. On the other side, it should increase its spending only in targeted areas like policies influencing the migration of rural workers to urban settlements</i>. </p> <p>Ensuring this, Chinese government can bring the economy back to its long run level of exchange rate and domestic spending that will maintain both internal and external balance.</p></div></div></div>
