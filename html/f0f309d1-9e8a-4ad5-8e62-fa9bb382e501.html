                                        <p>Question 1.</p> <p>A. the aim of the data mining is to take large amount of data from any available source and process the data in into more usable form where as the aim of the data science is to process data in order to make the data centric products for better decisions for the organisation. The machine learning is a a algorithm that gains the data and use that data in order to enhance itself in order to serve the functionality in a more efficient way.</p> <p>B. the major difference between the knowledge discovery in the data bases and the data mining is that the database have limited amount of information that can be used to extract the knowledge from the database where as data mining have large amount of data from which large amount of knowledge can be acquired and made information more useful.</p>
