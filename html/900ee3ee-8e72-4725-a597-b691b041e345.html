This means that the purchase price is not the only expenditure incurred, there are other expenditures like transportation, property taxes. Few examples of long-term assets are land, land improvements, buildings, equipment and even natural resources. </p> </div></div><div class="col"><div class="answer"> <p>The company purchased land, building and equipment all for $400,000.
