in size<br>
through mitosis.<br>
C. All other organs such as kidneys, bladder, liver, lungs, and

<p style="margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;">11. Between 1959 and
1961, thalidomide was prescribed to expectant mothers<br>
in Canada for morning sickness. Once it was determined that
thalidomide<br>
was linked to miscarriages and birth defects, it was pulled from
Canadian<br>
pharmacies in 1962. It is estimated that over 20 000 individuals
worldwide<br>
were affected by thalidomide. There are approximately 100
thalidomide survivors<br>
in Canada who have been approved to receive compensation from
the<br>
federal government.<br>
Which of the following over the counter and prescription
medications have not<br>
been linked with birth defects or problems with pregnancy? (Some
research may<br>
be required.)<br>
A. Isotretinoin for acne<br>
B. Advil (ibuprofen)<br>
C. Valproic acid for epilepsy<br>
D. Amoxicillin as an antibiotic</p>
<p style="margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;">18. Which of the
following hormones are involved in uterine contractions</p>
<p style="margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;">during
parturition?<br>
A. Oxytocin and prostaglandins<br>
B. Prolactin and oxytocin<br>
C. Estrogen and progesterone<br>
D. Prostaglandins and prolactin</p>
<p style="margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;">20. Labour is
controlled by the nervous and endocrine systems through a
positive</p>
<p style="margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;">feedback system.<br>
In which example have we encountered another positive feedback
system in<br>
Biology 30?<br>
A. Progesterone during menstruation<br>
B. Reflex loop in the PNS<br>
C. Estrogen during ovulation<br>
D. FSH levels during sperm production</p>
<p style="margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;">21. There are two
hormones involved in lactation. The hormone involved in the<br>
production of the milk and the hormone involved in releasing
milk,<br>
respectively, are<br>
A. prolactin and oxytocin<br>
B. oxytocin and prolactin<br>
C. prolactin and progesterone<br>
D. colostrum and oxytocin</p>
<p style="margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;">24. Identify the
manipulated and responding variable(s) in the study by placing the
letter of<br>
the type of variable in the blank.<br>
Variable:<br>
Patients with normal blood glucose<br>
Level of oxytocin<br>
Patients with Type 2 diabetes</p>
<p style="margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;">A. Manipulated<br>

<p style="margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;">25. Which of the
following statements does not correctly describe the
similarities</p>
<p style="margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;">and differences
between male and female reproductive systems?<br>
A. Eggs and sperm can survive for 3 to 5 days in the Fallopian
tubes.<br>
B. Eggs and sperm contain exactly half of the genetic material of a
normal<br>
somatic cell. Many zygotes with an abnormal number of genetic
material<br>
often do not successfully implant.<br>
C. Millions of mature sperm are produced on a daily basis, whereas
single<br>
mature ovum is released every 28 days.<br>
D. Meiosis is completed after fertilization in eggs, whereas a
mature sperm has<br>
completed meiosis prior to fertilization.</p>
<p style="margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;">27. Which description
below explains how the hormones released in birth control</p>
<p style="margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;">pills causes natural
ovulation to cease?<br>
A. Birth control pills release progesterone. Progesterone feeds
back to the<br>
pituitary gland, thereby inhibiting FSH and LH and in effect,
stopping the<br>
ovarian and menstrual cycle.<br>
B. Birth control pills release estrogen. Estrogen controls the
secondary sex<br>
characteristics of the female body.<br>
C. Birth control pills release progesterone. Progesterone causes an
increase in<br>
FSH, thereby increasing the production of follicles.<br>
D. Birth control pills release estrogen. Estrogen feeds back to the
posterior<br>
pituitary, causing an increase of LH and thereby ceasing the
ovarian cycle.</p>
<p style="margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;">28. Which of the
following statements correctly identifies the differences
between</p>
<p style="margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;">spermicidal jelly and
a condom?<br>
A. Condoms form a barrier to protect against sperm movement as well
as<br>
viruses. Spermicidal jelly breaks down cell membranes of
bacteria.<br>
B. Condoms are semipermeable membranes whereas spermicidal jelly
does not<br>
form any barrier.<br>
C. Condoms prevent the physical transfer of most sexual
secretions.<br>
Spermicidal jelly kills sperm, but allows fluid transfer.<br>
D. Condoms contain an antibacterial coating while spermicidal jelly
only kills<br>
sperm cells.</p>
<p style="margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;">36. Match each
statement with the perspective it exemplifies.<br>
<strong>Perspective:</strong><br>
Ethical<br>
Cultural<br>
Societal<br>
Economic</p>
<p style="margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;"><strong>Some
Statements Related to Monitoring<br>
Fetal Development:</strong><br>
A. Small portable ultrasound machines<br>
should be banned in countries that<br>
promote female feticide.<br>
B. Chorionic villus sampling allows<br>
mothers to decide if they would like<br>
to terminate their pregnancy if the<br>
baby has any genetic disorders.<br>
C. Prenatal diagnostic procedures such<br>
as amniocentesis create negative<br>
attitudes toward genetic disabilities<br>
such as Down syndrome.<br>
D. Prenatal testings can alleviate the<br>
burden on the Alberta health care.</p>

                                        <p>3. answer could be <strong>D. umbulical cord and placenta begins to form.</strong></p> <p>placenta forms tiny hair like projections that extend into wall of uterus.blood vesseles from embryo which pass through umbulical cord to placenta develop in the villi.</p> <p>oher body&nbsp;organs&nbsp;formation is completed but need more development.</p> <p>after end of&nbsp;8th week, embryo is called fetus.&nbsp;</p> <p>upto 6 week all tissue differentiation is completed.</p> <p>5. answer could be <strong>D. A. anecephaly B. folic acid</strong></p> <p>because a lack of folic acid (vit. B9) before and during pregnancy may increase the chance of nural tube defects such as anecephaly.</p> <p>spina bifida is also folic deficiency occurs due to lack of Vit. B 9 not B 12.</p> <p>malformation of limbs caused due to some medications,being exposed to viruses.</p> <p>due to zika virus microcephaly occurs, but it does not fit in sentence.</p> <p>11. answer could be <strong>D. amoxicillin as antibiotic</strong></p> <p>because this drug is considered low risk if women takes it in any trimester of pregnancy.</p> <p>isotretenoin can cause birth defects.it can be severe and include deformalities in heart,face, brain.</p> <p>ibuprofen can increase the chances of birth defects in first trimester.</p> <p>valproic acid can increase the chances of birth defects.</p> <p>18. answer could be <strong>A. oxytocin and prostaglandins</strong></p> <p>prostaglandins triggers muscle uterus to contract, it also stimulates oxytocin which can increase contractions further.</p> <p>prolactins responsible for metabolism, regulation of immune system and lactation. oxytocin stimulates prolactin to release milk from gland.</p> <p>estrogen, progesteron inhibits uterine contractions.</p> <p>colostrum is first milk from mother&#39;s body, it is not direcly involved in uterine contractions.</p> <p>24. manipulated. but sorry, i didn&#39;t understand the meaning of the question. could you clarify it please ?</p> <p>25.answer could be&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;A.</strong></p> <p>sperm&nbsp;can survive foe 3-5 days but human egg can only survive for 24-48 hrs only.</p> <p>all others options are correct.</p> <p>27. <strong>answer could be D. release estrogen</strong></p> <p>because actually birth control pills release estrogen and progesteron,to prevent ovulation.they inhibit body&#39;s natural cyclic hormones to prevent pregnancy.estrogen cease the ovarian cycle.</p> <p>mainly estrogen is worked , progesteron is secondary. so all other options are seems to be unfit.</p> <p>28. <strong>answer could be C.</strong></p> <p>condomes avoid physical transfer of most physical transfer of most sexual secretions, while spermicidal gelly kills the sperms and allows fluid transfer, spremicidal gelly contains spermicide.</p> <p>now condoms are available witha antibacterial coating, but is is not recommended by doctors.</p> <p>spermicidal gelly forms a barrier so option B&nbsp;is incorrect.</p> <p>36.
