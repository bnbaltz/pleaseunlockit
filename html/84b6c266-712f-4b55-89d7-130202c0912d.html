information&nbsp;and instructions associated with property. Online
aggregators may also not give proper

<p>False. A buyers' agent represents the buyer. A sellers' agent
represents the seller. Brokers can represent both buyer and
seller.</p>
<p>Dual agency is illegal in eight states-&nbsp;Alaska, Colorado,
Florida, Kansas, Maryland, Oklahoma, Texas, and Vermont&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exclusive contracts are signed between buyer's agent and buyer
or Seller's agent and Seller. These agreement&nbsp;state that&nbsp;
buyers/ sellers can work solely with agents they have entered into
an agreement.</p>
<p>A perfect real estate agent would have- a good experience of
working with home buyers ( if you are a buyer) , catering to a
price range of interest in area&nbsp;of interest , good
list-to-sale ratio minimum commission. The right person to inform
on borrowing qualification would be a banker and actually, agents
would ask that information from prospective buyers.</p>
<p>Buying a foreclosed income is risky because:</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; They are usually "sold as is".Since properties in
foreclosure aren't well maintained&nbsp;typically, money on
improvement would need to be spent by buyer.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp; Inability to inspect the home in advance may
result in unreliable estimate of improvements needed</p>
