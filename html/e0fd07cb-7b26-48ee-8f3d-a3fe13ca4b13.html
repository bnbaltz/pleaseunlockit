                                        <p>23) The answer is <strong>option C </strong>natural selection,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>genetic drift, migration and mutation can all happen at the same time. These are mechanisms affect Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium. These can occur alone or all together which leads to evolution. Natural selection is the mechanism in which new phenotypic variations are formed for an organism which positively of negatively affect their survival. Genetic drift is the mechanism occur in the small population in which chane in frequency of gene is purely by chance. Migration is the mechanism in which oganism move from one place to another so gene flow take place. Mutation is sudden change in gene leads to evolution. <strong>Example</strong> in a small population of Red coloured beetles there occur a mutation in their colour gene and new green colour genes are fromed in that population half of red beetles are eatten by crow because they are clearly vissible in green bushes than green beetles (natural selection). The half of rest red beetles are killed by elephat by steping on them by chance ( genetic drift). The rest red beetles move from the popoulation to near by population in red bushes to avoid predation (migration). So the whole beetle is green in colour now.</p> <p>24) The answer is <strong>option A</strong>&nbsp;Allele frequency will become more similar across populations; adaptation to local conditions&nbsp; will be reduced. Allele frequency of all human races will be mixed or become more similar. Each races have phenotypes and genotypes for surviving in local environmental conditions. <strong>Example</strong> An individual of&nbsp;a race which is modified to leave in hot enviroment&nbsp;mate with an individual of a race modified to leave in cold environment. Their progeny may not have an special ability to live in any extreme envitonment. Other options are wrong because in option B it is saying that only migration happen as evolutionary mechanisms all other get ceased. But it is wrong because their chance for mutation, chromosomal abberations and hybridisation etc. In option C it is saying that evolutionary process will be slowed but it is wrong because the gene flow is increasing so the evolutionary chance is increased. In option D it is saying genetic drift increases but it is wrong because genetic drift happens in small population.</p> <p>25) The answer is<strong> option A</strong>&nbsp;Japanese ragweed is&nbsp;evolveing back toward greater investment in defence and reduced investment in growth as a result of selection by herbivory from beetles. Because it is given that a ragweed comes to Japan long ago by leaveing behind its natural enemies so it reduced its investment in defense because of no enemies. After centuries because of the less defence the other native beetles select it as their feeding plant. So to escape this they evolve back.</p>
