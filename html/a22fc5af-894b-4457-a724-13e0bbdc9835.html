                                    <p>Montgomery Corp is currently worth $30 million as a company, but
has $50 million of debt. There is a potential project that costs
$60 million that would require shareholders to provide an
additional $30 million to invest in. In one year, the project will
yield $99 million or $55 million with 50% probability each. If the
investment is not made, the firm will file for bankruptcy today.
Suppose a 10% discount rate.</p>
<p>The shareholders will _____ the investment because they stand to
_____. The investment is _____ for the firm and _____ for the
debtholders.</p>

                                        <p>Firm Value = $30 million</p>
<p>Value of Debt = $50 million, Value of equity = Value of firm -
value of debt = - $20 million&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Investment is not made, and company files for bankruptcy</p>
<p>Benefit to Debtholders= $30 -$50 = - $20 million</p>
<p>Benefit to Shareholders = 0 - (-$20 million ) = $20 million</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Investment is made&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cost of New project= $60 million ($30 million original
value&nbsp;and $30 million additional equity)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Expected yield from project after one year = 0.5*$99 million
+0.5*$55 million =$77 million</p>
<p>NPV of project = -$60 + $77/1.1 =<strong>$10
million</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;So, total value of firm =$30 million (original ) + $30
million (additional equity) +$10 million (NPV) =$70 million</p>
<p>Value of Debt =$50 million&nbsp;&nbsp;,Value of&nbsp; Equity =
$70-$50 =$20 million</p>
<p>&nbsp;In case of Bankruptcy</p>
<p>Benefit&nbsp;&nbsp;to Debtholders =&nbsp;$50 million</p>
<p>Benefit to Equityholders = $20 million</p>
<p><strong>As Equity holders only get $20 million on investing $30
million additional ,shareholders will disapprove the project as
they stand to lose $10 million, the investment is bad for the
firm&nbsp; but good for the debtholders&nbsp; &nbsp;.... (3rd
