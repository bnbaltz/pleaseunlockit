It is used in the medicine, the spores are highly flammable and used to creat flames or flashes, it can also be used to determine the molecular size of oleic acid&nbsp;</p> <p>Uses of the body of Lycopodium : Explosives, fireworks, covering of pills, ice cream stabilizer.&nbsp;</p> <p>1.2 Selaginella also has roots that arise from the rhizophore.</p> <p>1.3 Megaspores are specifically female and give rise to female gametophytes while microspores are specifically male and give rise to male gametophytes.</p> <p>1.4 Xylem transports water and minerals from the roots, phloem transports food materials prepared by the green parts of the plant to other parts of the plant body; xylem is the dead tissue, phloem is the living tissue; xylem contains xylem parechyma cells and tracheid cells, phloem contains sieve tube cells, companion cells and phloem parenchyma cells; xylem cells are star shaped, phloem cells are not.</p> <p>For the adaptation to land, plants develop complex root and shoot system through the evolution of xylem and phloem. They are responsible for transportation of water, minerals and the products of photosynthesis.</p> <p>1.5 Reproduction through spores and having alteration of genotypes and having sporophyte generation as dominant are the features that group Lycopodium and Selaginella in the same phylum.</p> <p>1.6 For the adaptation to land, plants develop complex root and shoot system through the evolution of xylem and phloem.
