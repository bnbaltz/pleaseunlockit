                                        <p>&bull;Myth: Myths are stories that depend on convention. Some may have genuine inceptions, while others are totally anecdotal. In any case, myths are more than simple stories and they fill a more significant need in old and current societies. Myths are holy stories that clarify the world and man&#39;s insight.</p> <p>&bull;Science :&nbsp;</p> <p>Science is an orderly venture that fabricates and arranges information as testable clarifications and expectations about the universe. It is the interest and use of information and comprehension of the characteristic and social world after a precise strategy dependent on proof.</p> <p>&bull;The most significant difference between the science and myth is that , science provides explanation or the proofs behind any phenomenon it explains where as myths are just the stories , may be correct but with no proofs .&nbsp;</p> <p>Methodology and proof provide the significant difference between the two.</p> <p>Science researches the obscure, concocts speculations, at that point conducts analyses to verify or refute those theories, at that point rehash to find out more. Mythology make declarations and attestations about the world and guarantee absolute information, along these lines dispensing with any requirement for additional questioning.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;Thanks:)...</p>
