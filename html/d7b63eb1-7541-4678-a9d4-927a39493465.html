                                    <p>Jennifer is interested in training two of her new puppies to
participate in agility competitions. One of the puppies, Sasha, was
given a treat each time she more closely approximated the behavior
that Jennifer wanted from her. Then she got a treat every third
time she completed the entire behavior correctly. The other puppy,
Rosie, was exposed to a harsh sound whenever she did the wrong
behavior.</p>
<p>In the chart, Jennifer kept track of the number of correctly
completed behaviors for each puppy, in order to know which one will
be best for competition.</p>

                                        <p>A.</p> <p>1. In this experiment, the independent variable that is being changed is the method Jennifer uses to reinforce the puppies. In Sasha&#39;s case, it is the treat given&nbsp;and in Rosie&#39;s case, it is the harsh sound.&nbsp;</p> <p>2. The dependent variable is the agility behavior that is exhibited by both the puppies.&nbsp;</p> <p>3. The confounding variables are those variables that have an influence on the outcome of the experiment and cannot be controlled by the experimenter. These could include- the mood of the puppies at the time, nature of the weather during the experiment, etc.&nbsp;</p> <p>4.&nbsp; The ethical treatment of the subjects comes into question when one looks into the independent variable in Rosie&#39;s case. The utilization of negative reinforcement such as harsh noises has a tendency to elicit a fear response from the subject. This is illustrated in the controversial experiment conducted by Albert Bandura.&nbsp;</p> <p>5. Behavioral shaping- The method and schedule of reinforcement are seen with Sasha. The reinforcer is provided when Sasha exhibits behavior that is approximate to the desired one. This method is known as shaping.&nbsp;</p> <p>B.</p> <p>1. The mean is calculated using the formula :</p> <p>Mean= Sum of Correct Behaviors of Sasha/ No. of days</p> <p>Mean= 10+12+15+16/4</p> <p>Mean= 53/4</p> <p>Mean= 13.25</p> <p>2. The mode is the most frequently occurring number of correct&nbsp; behavior of Rosie:</p> <p>Number of correct behaviors = 2,1,2,3</p> <p>2 is the most frequently occurring number of correct behavior made by Rosie, hence the mode is 2.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>
