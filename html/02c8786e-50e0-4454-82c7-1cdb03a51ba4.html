<p>Amazon's main strength is its advantage as the first in the
market, access to resources, opportunities, networks that allow
them to suppress competition. This power translates into greater
market share and bargaining power of publishers, as well as a model
warehouse that generates large sales volumes.</p>
<p>Amazon's weakness is its low presence of brick and mortar
compared to the competition. Therefore, the buyer cannot become
familiar with the first-hand product until he purchases it (Bossman
2010). This can affect the sale of Kindle online because buyers may
have some concerns. The patented format of electronic books is also
a weakness because there is a demand for more options and greater
reach from customers.</p>
