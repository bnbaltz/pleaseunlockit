                                    <p>Steve Arnold is a manager at Acme Manufacturing Company in
Birmingham, England. When Steve drove into the parking lot at the
plant on Tuesday morning at 8:35, he was already 35 minutes late
for work. Steve had overslept that morning because the night before
he had stayed up late to finish the monthly production report for
his department. He parked his car and entered the rear of the plant
building. Passing through the shipping area, Steve spotted his
friend George Summers and stopped to ask how work was progressing
on the new addition to George's house.</p>
<p>Entering the office at 8:55, Steve greeted his secretary, Ruth
Sweeney, and asked whether anything urgent needed his immediate
attention. Ruth reminded him of the staff meeting at 9:30 with
Steve's Boss-Frank Jones, the vice president for Production and the
other production managers, Steve thanked Ruth for reminding him (he
had forgotten about the meeting) and continued on to his adjoining
inner office. He went to his desk and began looking through the
piles of papers to find the memo announcing the meeting, He vaguely
remembered getting the memo last week, but had not had time to read
it or look at the attached materials. His phone rang, and it was
Sue Bradley, the Sales vice president, who was inquiring about the
status of a rush order for one of the company's important client.
Steve promised to look into the matter and get back to her later in
the day with an answer. Steve had delegated the rush order last
week to Lucy Adams, one of his production supervisors, and he had
not thought about it since then. Stepping back in the outer office,
Steve asked Ruth if she had seen Lucy today. Ruth reminded him that
Lucy was at a training workshop in California. She would be
difficult to reach until the session ended late in the afternoon,
because the workshop facilitators regard cell phone calls and text
messages unnecessary distraction. Going back into his office, Steve
emailed a message to Lucy asking her to call him as soon as
possible. Then he resumed his search for the memo about the meeting
with his boss and the other production managers. He finally found
it in large collection of unprocessed emails. The purpose of the
meeting as to discuss a proposed change in quality control
procedures. By now it is 9:25, and there was no time to read the
proposal. He hurried out to get into the meeting on time. During
the meeting, the other production managers participated in the
discussion and made helpful comments and suggestions. Steve was not
prepared for the meeting and did not contribute much except to say
that he did not anticipate any problems with the proposed
change.</p>
<p>The meeting ended at 10:30 and Steve returned to his office,
where he found Paul Chen, one of the production Supervisors waiting
for him. Paul wanted to discuss a problem cause in the production
schedule by a major equipment breakdown. Steve called Glenda Brown,
his Assistant Manager, and asked her to join them to help rearrange
the production schedules for the next few days. Glenda same in
shortly and the three of them worked on the production schedule. At
11:25, Ruth came in to announce that Mr. Ferris was waiting and he
claimed to have an appointment. Steve asked Ruth to tell Mr. Ferris
that would be ready shortly. The schedules were completed about
11:40. Since it was nearly noon, Steve invited Mr. Ferris to join
him for lunch at a nearby restaurant. During the lunch, Steve
learnt that Mr. Ferris was from one of the firms that provided
materials used in the production process at ACME and the purpose of
the meeting was to inquire about some of the changes in material
specification the company had requested. As Mr. Ferris talked,
Steve realized that he would not be able to answer some of the
technical questions. When they returned to the plant at 1:15, Steve
introduced Mr. Ferris to an Engineer who could answer his
questions. Soon after Steve walked back to this office, his boss
(Frank Jones) stopped in to ask about the quality report for last
week. Steve explained that he had given top priority to finishing
the monthly production report and would do the quality report next.
Frank was irritated because he needed the quality data to finalize
his proposal for new procedures, and he though Steve understood
this task was more urgent than the production report. He told Steve
to get the quality data for him as soon as possible and left. Steve
immediately called Glenda Brown and ask her to bring the quality
data to his office. The task of reviewing the data and preparing a
short summary was not difficult, but it took a longer he
anticipated. It was 2:40 by the time Steve completed the report and
attached it to an email to his boss. Looking at his calendar, Steve
noticed that was already late for a 2:30 meeting of the plant
safety committee. The committee meets weekly to review the safety
problems, and each department send a representative. Steve rushed
out to the meeting which was held in another part of the plant. The
meeting was dull this week, without any important issues or
problems to discuss. The meeting ended at 3:30, and as Steve walked
back to through his section of the plant, he stopped to talk to his
assistant manager. Glenda wanted some advice on how to resolve a
problem in the production assignment for the next day. They
discussed the problem for about half hour. When Steve returned to
his office, it was 4:05, his secretary was just leaving. She
reported that Lucy had called before leaving to fly home from the
conference. Steve was feeling tired and decided it was time for him
to go him also. As he drove out of the parking lot, Steve reflected
that he was getting further behind in his work. He wondered what he
could do to get better control over his job.</p>
