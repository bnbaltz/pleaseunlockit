                            </h4>

                            <div class="row">
                                <div class="col-md-9">
                                    <p>1.&nbsp;<strong>To claim that a person’s autonomous choice is
worthy of moral deference is to suggest that:</strong></p>
<p><strong>a.&nbsp;</strong>their choice is not worthy of
respect&nbsp;</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;we should respect the agent's decision and not intervene
to prevent them from making that choice&nbsp;</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;we should not say anything negative about that
choice&nbsp;</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;we are morally justified in exercising
paternalism&nbsp;with regard to&nbsp;that choice&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;<strong>Aristotle characterizes each of the virtues as a
“mean between two extremes.” Which of the following is an accurate
portrayal of this “rule of the Golden Mean”?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>a.&nbsp;</strong>Courage is a mean, or balance, between
dishonesty and disloyalty.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;A person must express extreme courage, generosity, and
loyalty in order to be considered virtuous.&nbsp;</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;To be courageous means to not give into one's fears
completely (and be cowardly), and to not ignore one's fears
completely (and be reckless), but to respond to fear in the right
way, toward the right people, at the right time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;Acting virtuously helps a person to achieve eudaimonia,
or a flourishing life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;<strong>According to Preston-Roedder, what can the
virtue of faith in humanity help us to achieve or
accomplish?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>a. It can prompt the person on the receiving end of this virtue
to do the right thing.</p>
<p>b. It can help us to give important moral support to other
people</p>
<p>c. It can prevent us from treating other people unjustly</p>
<p>d. All of above</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;<strong>According to one of the&nbsp;central
claims&nbsp;of cultural relativism,</strong></p>
<p><strong>a.&nbsp;</strong>each&nbsp;culture abides by the same
universal conceptions of right and wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;the&nbsp;moral code of each individual culture
determines what is right and wrong for the members of that
culture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;the&nbsp;moral codes of some cultures are superior to
the moral codes of others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;there&nbsp;are universal moral truths that one finds in
every culture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;<strong>In which of the following cases does Susan
Moller&nbsp;Okin&nbsp;think that multiculturalism undermines the
basic principles of a liberal society?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>a.&nbsp;whenever&nbsp;a minority culture is denied a special
group right&nbsp;</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;in all cases:&nbsp;Okin&nbsp;believes that
multiculturalism always violates the basic principles of liberal
societies&nbsp;</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;any time that a minority culture receives special group
rights&nbsp;</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;when the special group rights given to a minority
culture undermine the individual rights of that culture’s
members</p>
