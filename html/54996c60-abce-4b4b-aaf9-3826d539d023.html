                                        <p><strong>Question 6:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 - Taking folic acid supplements
even when not pregnant ensures that the level of folic acid in the
body is maintained and is adequate for the developing foetus in
case conception occurs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thus, the statement (1) is
true.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 - According to a study, it has
been found out that taking to much of folic acid during pregnancy
predisposes the child to develop diseases like autism, as well as
impaired fetal growth and promoting the growth of some cancer
cells.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thus, the statement (2) is
false.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 - Most people obtain adequate
amounts of folate from the diet with intake of foods like spinach,
lentils, beef liver, Brussels sprouts, etc. However, in women of
childbearing age, the need for folate is increased which puts them
at risk for developing folate deficiency. Women of childbearing age
should obtain 400 mcg/day folic acid from dietary supplements
and/or fortified foods in addition to the folate provided by a
varied diet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thus, the statement (3) is
false.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4 - It is quite true that women who
have folate deficiency are at an increased risk for giving birth to
children with neural tube defects (NTD's) like spina bifida and
anencephaly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thus, the statement (4) is
true.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5 - The Recommended Dietary
Allowance (RDA) for folic acid in women of childbearing age (19+
years) is 400 mcg of dietary folate equivalent (DFE). Folic acid is
used by our body to make new cells. It protects the baby from
serious birth defects as well as prevents in early pregnancy loss
(miscarriage). Folic acid is an essential vitamin needed for
keeping the red blood cells healthy. Deficiency of folic acid can
lead to a type of anaemia called folate-deficiency anaemia which is
more common in women of childbearing age. It is recommended by the
CDC that women should take folic acid (400mcg) every day one month
prior to trying to conceive.</p>
<p><strong>Thus, the statement (5) is false.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thus, the answer for Question (6) is 5,
3,2.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question 15:</strong></p>
<p>The feedback loop for lactation is:</p>
<p>Hypothalamus → (B) Anterior pituitary → (D) Prolactin → (F) Milk
production</p>
<p>Hypothalamus → (C) Posterior pituitary → (E) Oxytocin → Smooth
muscle contraction or <strong>milk ejection</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question 16:</strong></p>
<p>Oxytocin is secreted into the bloodstream from the posterior
pituitary and plays an important role in the uterine contractions
during labour. Thus, sometimes when enough oxytocin is not present
manufactured oxytocin has to be given to induce labour or to
strengthen the uterine contractions during childbirth.</p>
<p>Thus, the option (2) is the possible side effect.</p>
<p>As stated above, the uterine contractions are monitored by the
oxytocin level. A higher oxytocin level means the uterine
contractions will be stronger, while lower levels of oxytocin mean
weaker uterine contractions.</p>
<p>Thus, the option (3) is the possible side effect.</p>
<p>When oxytocin is released, it stimulates the increased release
of prostaglandins. Prostaglandins increase the contractions further
which help in the parturition. Increased levels of oxytocin lead to
increased levels of prostaglandins and decreased levels of oxytocin
lead to decreased levels of prostaglandins.</p>
<p>Thus, the option (6) is the possible side effect.</p>
<p>Oxytocin is released from the posterior pituitary which causes
the contraction of the smooth muscle or milk ejection. Decreased
levels of oxytocin would prevent the milk-ejection reflex and
prevent breastfeeding in the nursing mother.</p>
<p>Thus, the option (8) is the possible side effect.</p>
<p><strong>Hence, the answer will be 2, 3, 6, 8.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question 17:</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>manipulated or the independent variable</strong> is
the variable that the person conducting the experiment can change
during the course of the experiment or project.</p>
<p>The <strong>dependent variable or the responding
variable</strong> is the variable that is observed. The change in
the dependent variable with respect to the independent variable is
noted.</p>
<p>In the above experiment, patients with normal blood glucose and
Type 2 diabetes are observed for the side effects that lower levels
of oxytocin might create in the body.</p>
<p>Thus, the independent variable or the variable that is changed
during the experiment is the type of patients, i.e., whether normal
blood glucose type patients to patients with type 2
diabetes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dependent variable is the level of oxytocin, the level of
which&nbsp;is measured with respect to the change in the
independent variable.</p>
<p>Thus, the answer is:</p>
<p>Patients with normal blood glucose - (1) Manipulated</p>
<p>Level of Oxytocin - (2) Responding</p>
<p>Patients with Type 2 diabetes - (1) Manipulated</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question 18:</strong></p>
<p>Contraception can be defined as the different methods or
techniques used to prevent a woman from getting pregnant.</p>
<p>There are different methods by which contraception can be
achieved, but all of these techniques aim in preventing the sperm
from reading the eggs or by preventing the fusion of the sperm and
the egg to form the fertilized zygote.</p>
<p>Example - birth control pills, vasectomy, vaginal rings,
intrauterine devices (IUD's), condoms, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Question 21:</strong></p>
<p>The answers for the match the columns are:</p>
<p>Diaphragm - 5. The diaphragm covers the cervix and prevents the
sperm from entering the uterus.</p>
<p>Condom - 11. the condom is worn over the p-e-n-i-s and prevents
the semen from entering the woman's body. it acts as a physical
barrier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vasectomy - 10. The vasectomy procedure involves the cutting and
tying/sealing of the vas deferens&nbsp;to prevent the sperm from
entering the urethra and thus prevent pregnancy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tubal ligation - 1. The fallopian tubes of the female and cut
and sealed/ligated to prevent the egg from travelling through the
fallopian tubes as well as to prevent the sperm from travelling up
the tubes and fertilizing the egg.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question 26:</strong></p>
<p>Artificial insemination is a simpler process than in-vitro
fertilization (IVF).</p>
<p>In the process of artificial insemination, the semen is directly
introduced into the womb of a woman. The fertilization takes place
in the uterus of the woman while in IVF, the sperm and the egg are
fused together in a laboratory dish.</p>
<p><strong>Hence, the fourth option is correct.</strong></p>
<p>In IVF, a woman is given additional treatment with FSH and LH to
inside superovulation, but in artificial insemination (also known
as intrauterine insemination (IUI)) also FSH and LH are given to
the woman to stimulate the ovaries to produce more than one
follicle, hence increasing the chance of fertilization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During IVF, the sperm and the egg (gametes) are fused together
in a laboratory dish and the fertilized zygote is introduced into
the female. In artificial insemination, the semen is introduced
into the woman's womb in hopes of increasing the chances of
fertilization.</p>
<p>Both techniques of IVF and artificial insemination can be used
for surrogacy.</p>
<p>Thus, option four is the correct answer.&nbsp;</p>
