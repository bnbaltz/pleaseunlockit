main ones are as follows</p>
<p>1. Strategy : This is an important part for any buiness . for an
established business this part has already been done and their are
high chance that choosen strategy has turned out to be effective.

their strategy is based on a lot of ifs and buts. They may have
done a lot of market research and all but the result in totality is
yet to be seen. They must have a contingency strategy ready in case
the current strategy fails to deliver&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.Market scenario: Existing buiness know the market, they
understand the demand, supply scenario for their products. on the
other hand, start ups have to carefully study the market, make lot
of assumptions in understanding the market requirements to
determine demand for their product</p>
<p>Legal: Existing buinesses have legal team in plsace to counter
in case the failure happens where new business venture have to be
very cautious and take this contigency in to consideration&nbsp; as
well and be prepared for it.if any of their product faces the heat
of the cutomer or activists</p>
<p>Brand effect: establsihed buiness strategy have a benfit of
brand value recognition where as new business venture buiness plans
have to carve out their space in the existing market and deliver
good quality product with a focused marketing to build customer
recognition</p>
