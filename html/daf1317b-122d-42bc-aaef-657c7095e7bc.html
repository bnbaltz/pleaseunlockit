                                    <p><strong>Parker Hannifin Corporation</strong><sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Parker Hannifin Corporation is a leading manufacturer of
component parts used in aerospace, transportation, and
manufacturing equipment. The company makes several hundred thousand
parts—from heat-resistant seals for jet engines and components used
in the space shuttle to steel valves that hoist buckets on cherry
pickers. Parker Hannifin’s motor and control products are integral
components in global manufacturing and very few rivals have the
same product breadth and clout with customers (original-equipment
manufacturers) as the firm.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;When Donald Washkewicz
took over as chief executive, he came to an unnerving conclusion:
the pricing approach that the company had followed for years was
downright crazy.</p>
<p>For as long as anyone at the company could recall, the firm used
this simple approach to determine the prices for its thousands of
parts: Company managers would calculate how much it cost to make
and deliver each product and then add a flat percentage on top,
usually aiming for around a 35 percent margin. Across divisions,
many managers liked this cost-plus approach because it was
straightforward and gave them broad authority to negotiate prices
with customers.</p>
<p>But the chief executive feels that the firm, which generates
over 13 billion in annual revenues, may be severely restricting its
profit growth. No matter how much a particular product is improved,
the company often ends up charging the same premium that it would
for a standard product. And if the company finds a way to make a
product less expensively, it ultimately cuts the product’s price as
well. “I was actually losing sleep,” recalls Donald Washkewicz, who
believes that the company should stop thinking like a widget maker
or a cost-plus price setter and start thinking like a retailer by
determining prices by what customers are willing to pay.</p>
<p>Changing the firm’s pricing approach, however, is a complex
task. The company has tens of thousands of products— (1) some are
high-volume commodities and there are large, formidable
competitors; (2) some have unique features, fill niches in the
market, and have limited competition; and (3) many are
custom-designed for a single customer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Describe the process that you would follow in performing an
audit of the firm's product line to identify those products that
represent the best and worst candidates for profit-margin
expansion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Provide a set of specific pricing guidelines that managers
should apply as the traditional cost-plus approach is phased out
and a value-based approach to pricing is implemented.</p>
