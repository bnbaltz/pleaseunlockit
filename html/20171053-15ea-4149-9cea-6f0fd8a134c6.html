<p>Apple is a renowned premier brand recognized around the world.
The brand "Apple" was created in 1976 by Steve Jobs and Steve
Wozniak&nbsp;who initially sold personal computers through their
company Apple Computers. In &nbsp;the year 1977 they incorporated
the company as Apple Inc. The first personal computer they
introduced was a type writer kind of device which could be
connected to a TV set for output. This was later referred as Apple
I. After a moderate success of this device, they introduced an
upgraded version known as Apple II. This had a gradual growth
leading to huge success eventually. Apple II had a software app
known as VisiCalc that could calculate on-screen in table form and
became one of the main reasons for the success of this model. Apple
III was introduced in due course with added hardware and
functionalities and it continued the growth story of Apple
products.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next success that Apple reaped was with the introduction of
Macintosh series of computers, which had several innovations and
features that form the core of present day computers. Thereafter
Apple never looked back and went from strength to strength&nbsp;and
introduced world famous products such as iPhone, iPad, Apple watch
and personal computers among others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SWOT analysis of "Apple Inc."</p>
<p><u>Strengths</u></p>
<p>Its main strength is the high premium value its brand commands
in the market. Besides, innovative products, features and software
make Apple brand unbeatable by its contemporaries.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Weakness</u></p>
<p>It has got limited number of products and variants as compared
to competition which limits its coverage to a niche segment of
buyers only. Secondly the high prices of the products also limits
its expansion to the budget conscious consumers.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Opportunities</u></p>
<p>Penetration in large consumer base countries in Asia; Expansion
of iPhone and iPad tablets in more affordable variants and
introduction of premier innovative products that will get instant
recognition in the market. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Threats</u></p>
<p>Competition from products originating from Asian countries that
are cheap and technically advanced may lead to declining sales.
Also the limited customization and adaptability of its
iOS&nbsp;operating system as compared to rival Android based
operating system may deter customers.&nbsp;</p>
