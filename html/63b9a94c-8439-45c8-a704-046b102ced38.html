                                    <p>3 data scientists work on a cluster which has a daily limit of 2
compute ’credits’. When the total daily amount of compute credits
of the three data scientists exceeds that daily limit, the company
is charged a one thousand dollar penalty. Assume each data
scientist’s daily cluster usage in compute credits is distributed
between 0 and 1 and that the chance the usage belongs in some
subinterval of [0, 1] is equal to the length of the subinterval.
Assume also that the daily usages of the data scientists across the
year are independent. You are asked to estimate the total cost of
this penalty over one business year (252 days) with a single
number. What is your succinct response?</p>

                                        <p>Total usage of compute credits for all 3 scientists in a day would vary between [0,3]. Now, it is clear in the question that it would be equally likely to have total compute credit in that interval at any point. Now across an year, on an average they will cross the limit of 2 compute credits once in three days. Because probability of [2,3] in [0,3] is 1/3.<br /> Hence, total penalty would be (252/3)*1000 = <strong>$84000</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
