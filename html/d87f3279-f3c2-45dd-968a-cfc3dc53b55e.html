Company acquires notebook from corporations to upgrade computer system for warranty of 90 days. Past experience says company warranty cost to 6% of sales and sales for the month of December is $600,000. Actual expenditure in January is $13,000. Therefore the Company has to record warranty expenses in the present accounting year on amount of product sales.
