<p>1. What makes a skeletal muscle slide easy to identify from
other tissue slides?</p>
<p>2. When you see a highly structured muscle cell with many nuclei
pushed to one side, which muscle type is being observed?</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;What structure is unique and can be used to
differentiate between smooth muscle slide and a cardiac muscle
slide?</p>
<p>4. Why can it be hard to identify the smooth muscles in a
slide?</p>
<p>5. Which muscle type is being observed when small capillaries
are found throughout the tissue?</p>

                                        <p>Answer:&nbsp;</p> <p>1.Under light microscope skeletal muscle appear striated ( sarcomeres) with many nuclei squeezed along membrane.&nbsp;</p> <p>2. Skeletal muscle : They are multinucleated because they are formed by fussion of embryonic myoblasts.&nbsp;</p> <p>3. Unique nature of cardiac muscle are branching morphology and presence of intercalated discs between muscle fibres.&nbsp;</p> <p>4. Smooth muscles are mononucleated fibers with tapered edges and have no striations. Smooth muscle are found wrapping around their associated organ, hence it is hard to find an entire smooth muscle fibre in microscope slide. Most of fibre will be difficult to get on single plane of focus or will be sectioned at angles.&nbsp;</p> <p>5. Type 1 or Red muscle which is subtypeof skeletal muscle which have dense capillaries, mitochondria and myoglobin. It can sustain aerobic activity.&nbsp;</p>
