But not to the desk worker, Sally, who was half a block away from the accident. Consider the legal statement stated below:</p> </div></div><div class="col"><div class="answer"> <p>Under the Restatement, if an actor’s conduct is a substantial factor in bringing about harm to another, the fact that the actor neither foresaw nor should have foreseen the extent of the harm or the manner in which it occurred does not prevent him from being liable. However, the actor’s conduct will not be held to be a legal cause of harm to another where, after the event and looking back from the harm to the actor’s negligent conduct, it appears to the court highly extraordinary that it should have brought about the harm. Negligence limits the requirement of reasonable care to those risks that are foreseeable.</p> </div></div><div class="col"><div class="answer"> <p>Accordingly, Led Foot would be liable to V because, Led Foot could foresee, and should have realized that his negligent driving might result in a collision. The collision would have endangered or harmed pedestrians nearby. Whereas, injuries to Sally, who was half a block away from the accident, but got hit by shattered glasses, caused by the explosion, are beyond the risks posed by Led Foot’s negligent driving. Her injuries not being foreseeable, thus, they were not considered as a harm arising from negligent driving.</p> <p>Therefore, Led Foot would be liable to the pedestrian, but not the desk worker.</p></div></div></div>
