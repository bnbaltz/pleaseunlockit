                                        <p>A) the rock illustrated seem to be a volcanic vesicular rock. This is an igneous rock filled with high amount of volatiles erupted on surface to form fine grained volcanic rock. Due to decompression the volatiles dissolved in magma is released creating large vesicles.&nbsp;</p> <p>B) this rock in figure seem to have formed from a felcic igneous rock with intrusive setting. The grain sizes of the rock suggests intrusive setting as magma cooled during a long period in intrusion. The colour of grains in rock is leucocratic suggesting felcic composition.&nbsp;</p> <p>C) the rock above seem to have formed in sedimentary environment. The rock has fine grains with presence of fossil remains suggesting a sedimentary origin of the rock.</p> <p>D) the rock in the image seem to have formed in a metamorphic terrain under high degree of temperature and pressure. This is evident from the texture of the grains which seem to have distorted and sheared along a particular direction . This shearing has created Schistose like banding in the rock.</p>
