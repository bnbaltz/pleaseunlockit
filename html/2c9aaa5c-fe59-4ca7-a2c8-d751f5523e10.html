                                    <p><strong>Credit screening.</strong> Tennindo, Inc. is starting up
its​&nbsp;new, cost-efficient gaming system​&nbsp;console, the yuu.
Tennindo currently has 4,500 ​cash-paying customers and makes a
profit of ​$80 per unit. Tennindo wants to expand its customer base
by allowing customers to buy on credit. It estimates that credit
sales will bring in an additional 1,300 customers per​&nbsp;year,
but that there will also be a default rate on credit sales of 5​%.
It costs ​$230 to make a​&nbsp;yuu, which retails for ​$310. If all
customers​&nbsp;(old and​&nbsp;new) buy on credit, what is the cost
of bad debt without credit​&nbsp;screening? What is the most
Tennindo would pay for credit screening that accurately
identifies​&nbsp;bad-debt customers prior to the​&nbsp;sale? What
are the increased profits from adding credit sales for customers
with and without credit​&nbsp;screening? Should Tennindo offer
credit sales if credit screening costs ​$10 per​&nbsp;customer?</p>
<p>If all customers​&nbsp;(old and​&nbsp;new) buy on​&nbsp;credit,
what is the cost of bad debt without credit​&nbsp;screening?

<p>What is the most Tennindo would pay for credit screening that
accurately identifies​&nbsp;bad-debt customers prior to
the​&nbsp;sale? ​$_______ (Round to the nearest​&nbsp;cent.)</p>
<p>If credit screening costs ​$10 per​&nbsp;customer, what are the
increased profits from adding credit sales for customers with and
without credit​&nbsp;screening? ​$_______ ​(Round to the
nearest​&nbsp;dollar.)</p>
<p>Compare​&nbsp;Tennindo's profit obtained if all customers paid
cash and its profits obtained if credit screening were used. Should
Tennindo offer credit sales if credit screening costs $10
per​&nbsp;customer? (Select the best​&nbsp;response.)</p>
<p>A.
Yes,&nbsp;Tennindo&nbsp;should&nbsp;offer&nbsp;credit&nbsp;sales&nbsp;because&nbsp;the&nbsp;credit&nbsp;screening&nbsp;will&nbsp;increase&nbsp;the&nbsp;firm's&nbsp;profit.</p>
<p>B. No,&nbsp;Tennindo should not offer credit sales because the
credit screening will decrease the firm's profit.</p>
