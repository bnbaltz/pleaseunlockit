                                        <p>1. In the early 1960s, Bob Dylan, the greatest songwriter,&nbsp;wrote most popular and celebrated songs such as &quot;Blowin&#39; in the Wind&quot; (1963) and <em>The Times They Are a-Changin</em>&nbsp;(1964), which attained the status of anthems for the anti-war campaigns and civil rights. Young adults loved Dylan&#39;s songs for they touched upon the current social,&nbsp;political and, philosophical issues. In 1962, Dylan brought out his debut album, songs mainly based on old folk songs such as&nbsp;<em>Blowin&#39; in the Wind</em>&nbsp;and<em> A Hard Rain&#39;s a-Gonna Fall</em>. His politically charged songs&nbsp;<em>The Times They Are a-Changin&#39;</em>&nbsp;and <em>Another Side of Bob Dylan</em>&nbsp;appealed to the listeners, He released three of the influential rock albums of the 1960s:&nbsp;<em>Bringing It All Back Home</em>&nbsp;(1965),&nbsp;<em>Highway 61 Revisited</em>&nbsp;(1965) and&nbsp;<em>Blonde on Blonde</em>&nbsp;(1966). Rolling Stone was so moved by Dylan&#39;s six-minute single Like a Rolling Stone&nbsp;(1965) that he commented&nbsp;&quot;No other pop song has so thoroughly challenged and transformed the commercial laws and artistic conventions of its time, for all time&quot; From being call &quot;nobody sings Dylan like Dylan&quot;, he metamorphosed from song writer to folk-rock music star and He received Nobel Prize &quot;for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition&quot;, so commented the Nobel Prize committee.&nbsp;In the 1960s, Dylan created, influcned by, folk, blues, country, R&amp;B, rock&#39;n&#39;roll, gospel, British beat,&nbsp;symbolist,&nbsp;modernist&nbsp;and Beat poetry,&nbsp;surrealism&nbsp;and&nbsp;Dada, such musical works in whic he blended a&nbsp;coherent and original artistic voice and vision.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>2. In the 60s and 70s, the folk-music started incorporating&nbsp;personal and poetic creations by individual performers, who called themselves &quot;singer-songwriters&quot;. The American folk evolution borrowed ethnic folk music from other countries, for example,the Greenwich Village folksingers such as The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Kakem&nbsp;were the most successful ethnic performers of the revival period. The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem popularized folk-music in Ireland in the mid-1960s, which had a global effect&nbsp;of the American folk-music revival.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>It was<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Dylan who brought two strong, separate<strong>&nbsp;</strong>influences&nbsp;into the form of&nbsp;rock music: poetry and folk&nbsp;music. A major influence in the evolution of folk music was book <em>Fireside Book of Folk Songs</em>&nbsp;(1947), which documented featured folk tradition&nbsp;in other languages such as Spanish, German, French, Italian, Yiddish, and Russian.&nbsp;</p> <p>Unlike other&nbsp;rock&nbsp;composers,&nbsp;Dylan knew modern poets such as Allen Ginsberg, and was responsible for bringing two strong influences&nbsp;into play. Dylan was a symbol of change, touching current issues like Viietnam War and combining them to folk music and from acoustic to electric guitar. Dylan was responsibel for killing Tin Pan Alley, which was the symbol of whole traditional form of recording music.</p>
